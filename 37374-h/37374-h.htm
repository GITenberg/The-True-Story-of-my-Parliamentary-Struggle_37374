<p class="hangindent">THE SELECT COMMITTEE appointed to inquire into
and consider the facts and circumstances under which
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span> claims to have the <span class="smcap">Oath</span> prescribed by
the 29 &amp; 30 Vict., c. 19, and 31 and 32 Vict., c. 72,
administered to him in this House; and also as to the
<span class="smcap">Law</span> applicable to such claim under such circumstances;
and as to the right and jurisdiction of this House to refuse
to allow the said form of the <span class="smcap">Oath</span> to be administered to
him; and to Report thereon to the House, together with
their Opinion thereon:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Have</span> agreed to the following
REPORT:&mdash;</p>

<p>In pursuance of the terms of the reference to your Committee,
they have inquired into and considered (1) the
facts and circumstances under which Mr. Bradlaugh claims
to have the oath prescribed by the Parliamentary Oaths
Act, 1866, and the Promissory Oaths Act, 1868, administered
to him in the House, (2) the Law applicable to such
claim under such circumstances, and (3) the right and jurisdiction
of the House to refuse to allow the form of the said
Oath to be administered to him.</p>

<p>In order to carry out such inquiry and consideration, your
Committee thought it right to examine Sir T. Erskine May
as a witness before them. Mr. Bradlaugh applied to be permitted
to make a statement to your Committee, and the
application was granted. After such statement had been
made by Mr. Bradlaugh, he submitted himself for examination,
and was examined by any Members of your Committee
who desired to put questions to him. Under the circumstances
appearing in the Evidence and in the Appendix to
this Report, your Committee admitted in evidence a letter
written by Mr. Bradlaugh to certain newspapers, dated 20th
May, 1880. All the evidence taken by your Committee
appears in the Appendix to this Report.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p class="center gap2"><i>Facts of the Case.</i></p>

<p>The facts and circumstances under which Mr. Bradlaugh
claimed to take and subscribe the Oath are as follow: On
Monday, the 3rd of May, Mr. Bradlaugh came to the Table
of the House and claimed to be allowed to affirm, as a
person for the time being by law permitted to make a solemn
affirmation instead of taking an oath; and on being asked
by the Clerk upon what grounds he claimed to make an
affirmation, he said that he did so by virtue of the
Evidence Amendment Acts, 1869 and 1870. Whereupon
Mr. Speaker informed Mr. Bradlaugh, &#8220;that if he desired
to address the House in explanation of his claim, he might
be permitted to do so.&#8221; In accordance with Mr. Speaker&#8217;s
intimation, Mr. Bradlaugh stated shortly that he relied on
the Evidence Further Amendment Act, 1869, and the
Evidence Amendment Act, 1870, adding, &#8220;I have repeatedly,
for nine years past, made an affirmation in the
highest courts of jurisdiction in this realm; I am ready
to make such a declaration or affirmation.&#8221; Thereupon Mr.
Speaker acquainted the House that Mr. Bradlaugh having
made such claim, he did not consider himself justified in
determining it; and having grave doubts on the construction
of the Acts above stated, he desired to refer the
matter to the judgment of the House. Thereupon a Select
Committee was appointed to consider and report their
opinion whether persons entitled, under the provisions of
the Evidence Amendment Acts, 1869 and 1870, to make a
solemn declaration instead of an oath in courts of justice,
might be admitted to make an affirmation or declaration
instead of an oath, in pursuance of the Acts 29 &amp; 30 Vict.
c. 19, and 31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 72; and on the 20th of May the
Committee reported that, in their opinion, persons so entitled
could not be admitted to make such affirmation or declaration
instead of an oath in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>On the day after the receipt of this Report, Mr. Bradlaugh
presented himself at the table of the House to take and
subscribe the Oath; and was proceeding to do so, when Sir
Henry Drummond Wolff, one of the Members for Portsmouth,
objected thereto, and Mr. Bradlaugh having been ordered to
withdraw, Sir H. D. Wolff moved, &#8220;That, in the opinion
of the House, Mr. Bradlaugh, the Member for Northampton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
ought not to be allowed to take the Oath which he then
required to be administered to him, in consequence of his
having previously claimed to make an affirmation or declaration
instead of the Oath prescribed by law, founding his
claim upon the terms of the Act 29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. 19, and
the Evidence Amendment Acts of 1869 and 1870; and on
the ground that under the provisions of those Acts the
presiding judge at a trial has been satisfied that the taking
of an oath would have no binding effects on his conscience.&#8221;
This Motion was superseded by an Amendment appointing
your Committee.</p>

<p class="center gap2"><i>The Law Applicable to Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s Claim.</i></p>

<p>Your Committee have been furnished by Sir T. Erskine
May with a list of precedents which illustrate the jurisdiction
and proceedings of the House in regard to the taking
of Oaths. These precedents, and others which Mr. Bradlaugh
placed before your Committee as bearing on the case,
will be found in the Appendix to this Report. They may
generally be divided into three classes: first, cases of refusal
to take the Oath; secondly, claims to make an Affirmation,
instead of taking the Oath; and, thirdly, claims to omit a
portion of the Oath of Abjuration. Among them there is
no precedent of any Member coming to the table to take
and subscribe the Oath, who has not been allowed to do so,
nor of any Member coming to the table and intimating
expressly, or by necessary implication, that an oath would
not, as an oath, be binding on his conscience. The present
case is, therefore, one of first impression.</p>

<p>Now there is not only a <i>prima facie</i> right, but it is the
duty of every Member who has been duly elected to take
and subscribe the Oath, or to affirm according to the
Statute. No instance has been brought to the attention of
your Committee in which any inquiry has been made into
the moral, religious, or political opinion of the person who
was desirous to take any Promissory Oath, or of any
objection being made to his taking such Oath. It would be
impossible to foresee the evils which might arise if a contrary
practice were sanctioned. But the question remains
whether, if a Member when about to take the Oath should
voluntarily make statements as to the binding effect of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Oath on his conscience, it is not within the power of the
House to take such statements into consideration, and
determine whether such member would, if he went through
the form of taking the Oath, be duly taking it within the
provisions of the Statute. In the present instance, when
Mr. Bradlaugh claimed under the Parliamentary Oaths
Acts his right to affirm, and also stated that he had on
several occasions been permitted in a Court of Justice to
affirm, and had affirmed under the Evidence Amendment
Acts, 1869 and 1870, he thereby in effect informed the
House that on such occasions a judge of such court had
been satisfied that an oath would have no binding effect
upon his conscience. Your Committee did not think it right
to accept this implication as conclusive without permitting
Mr. Bradlaugh an opportunity of making a statement to,
and giving evidence before, them. Nothing that has come
before your Committee has affected or altered their views as
to the effect of that which occurred when Mr. Bradlaugh
claimed to affirm, as above stated.</p>

<p class="center gap2"><i>As to the Right and Jurisdiction of the House.</i></p>

<p>As to the right and jurisdiction of the House to refuse to
allow the form of the Oath prescribed to be taken by duly
elected Members to be taken by them, your Committee are
of opinion that there is and must be an inherent power in
the House to require that the law by which the proceedings
of the House and of its Members in reference to the taking
of the Parliamentary Oath is regulated, be duly observed.
But this does not imply that there is any power in the
House to interrogate any Member desirous to take the Oath
of Allegiance upon any subject in connection with his
religious belief, or as to the extent the Oath will bind his
conscience; or that there is any power in the House to hear
any evidence in relation to such matters.</p>

<p>And your Committee are of opinion that by and in making
the claim to affirm, Mr. Bradlaugh voluntarily brought to
the notice of the House that on several occasions he had
been permitted in a Court of Justice to affirm, under the
Evidence Amendment Acts, 1869 and 1870, in order to
enable him to do which a Judge of the Court must have
been satisfied that an Oath was not binding upon Mr. Brad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>laugh&#8217;s
conscience; and, as he stated he had acted upon such
decisions by repeatedly making the Affirmation in Courts of
Justice; and, as above stated, nothing has appeared before
your Committee to cause them to think Mr. Bradlaugh
dissented from the correctness of such decisions, your
Committee are of opinion that, under the circumstances, the
compliance by Mr. Bradlaugh with the form used when an
oath is taken would not be the taking of an Oath within the
true meaning of the Statutes 29 Vict. c. 19. and 31 &amp; 32
Vict. c. 72; and, therefore, that the House can, and in the
opinion of your Committee ought, to prevent Mr. Bradlaugh
going through this form.</p>

<p>But your Committee desire to point out to your Honorable
House the position in which Mr. Bradlaugh will be
placed if he is not allowed either to take the Oath or
to affirm.</p>

<p>If the House of Commons prevent a duly elected Member
from taking the Oath or Affirming, there is no power of
reviewing or reversing that decision, however erroneous it
may be in point of law.</p>

<p>But it appears to your Committee that if a Member should
make and subscribe the Affirmation in place of taking and
subscribing the Oath, it would be possible, by means of an
action brought in the High Court of Justice, to test his legal
right to make such Affirmation.</p>

<p>The Committee appointed to inquire into the law relating
to the right of certain persons to affirm in effect recorded
that Mr. Bradlaugh was not entitled by law to make the
Affirmation.</p>

<p>But, from the fact that this Report was carried by the
vote of the Chairman, thus showing a great division of
opinion amongst the members of that Committee, the state
of the law upon the subject cannot be regarded as satisfactorily
determined. Under these circumstances it appears to
your Committee that Mr. Bradlaugh should have an
opportunity of having his statutory rights determined beyond
doubt by being allowed to take the only step by which the
legality of his making an Affirmation can be brought for
decision before the High Court of Justice.</p>

<p>The House, by an exercise of its powers, can, doubtless,
prevent Mr. Bradlaugh from obtaining such judicial decision;
but your Committee deprecate that course.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Your Committee accordingly recommend that should Mr.
Bradlaugh again seek to make and subscribe the Affirmation
he be not prevented from so doing.</p>

<p class="center gap2">Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Erskine May</span>, K.C.B.; Examined.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: You are the Clerk of the House of Commons?&mdash;I
am.</p>

<p>2. You, I believe, are perfectly acquainted with what
took place when Mr. Bradlaugh came to the table of the
House, and proposed to make his affirmation instead of
taking the oath?&mdash;Yes, I was personally present on that
day.</p>

<p>3. Will you have the kindness to state to the Committee
exactly what took place on that occasion, in order that we
may have the facts upon our proceedings?&mdash;I will read what
occurred, mainly from the Votes and Proceedings of the
House, in which an accurate and authentic record of the
proceedings of that day will be found. It appears that on
Monday the 3rd of May, 1880, &#8220;Mr. Bradlaugh, returned
as one of the Members for the borough of Northampton,
came to the table and delivered the following statement
in writing to the Clerk: &#8216;To the Right Honorable the
Speaker of the House of Commons. I, the undersigned
Charles Bradlaugh, beg respectfully to claim to be allowed
to affirm, as a person for the time being by law permitted
to make a solemn affirmation or declaration, instead of
taking an oath. (Signed) <span class="smcap">Charles Bradlaugh</span>.&#8217; And
being asked by the Clerk upon what grounds he claimed to
make an affirmation, he answered: By virtue of the Evidence
Amendment Acts, 1869 and 1870. Whereupon the
Clerk reported to Mr. Speaker, that Mr. Bradlaugh, Member
for the borough of Northampton, claimed to make an affirmation
or declaration instead of taking the Oath prescribed
by law, in virtue of the provisions of the Evidence Amendment
Acts, 1869 and 1870. Mr. Speaker thereupon informed
Mr. Bradlaugh that if he desired to address the House
in explanation of his claim he might be permitted to do so.
Mr. Bradlaugh addressed the House in accordance with Mr.
Speaker&#8217;s intimation, and then he was directed to withdraw.&#8221;
The Committee will observe that there is no entry
in the Votes of the words used by Mr. Bradlaugh; it is not
customary on such occasions to make an entry of the
observations made, which are considered to be part of the
debates of the House, which are not recorded in the Votes
and Proceedings; and there was no shorthand writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
authorised by the House to take notes, and therefore there
could have been no authentic record upon which one could
rely.</p>

<p>4. Have you any reason to believe that something was
said upon that occasion by Mr. Bradlaugh other than what
appeared upon the Votes?&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s observations
were very short. He repeated that he relied upon the
Evidence Further Amendment Act, 1869, and the Evidence
Amendment Act, 1870, adding, &#8220;I have repeatedly,
for nine years past, made an affirmation in the highest courts
of jurisdiction in this realm; I am ready to make such a
declaration or affirmation.&#8221; Substantially those were the
words which he addressed to the Speaker.</p>

<p>5. What took place after that?&mdash;Whereupon Mr. Speaker
addressed the House as follows: &#8220;I have now formally to
acquaint the House that Mr. Bradlaugh, Member for the
borough of Northampton, claims to make an affirmation
or declaration instead of the oath prescribed by law. He
founds this claim upon the terms of the 4th clause of the
Act 29 and 30 Vict., c. 19, and the Evidence Amendment
Acts, 1869 and 1870. I have not considered myself
justified in determining this claim myself, having grave
doubts on the construction of the Acts above stated, but
desire to refer the matter to the judgment of the House.&#8221;</p>

<p>6. That is substantially all that took place upon that
occasion?&mdash;I presume the Committee will scarcely desire
that I should proceed through all the subsequent Votes of
the House in regard to the appointment of the Committees.</p>

<p>7. There is nothing beyond what you have stated which
is material for the Committee to consider?&mdash;No, nothing
besides what happened on that day in reference to this
matter.</p>

<p>8. You are, of course, acquainted with the terms of
the reference to this Committee.&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>9. What were the proceedings which took place after the
Report of the former Committee?&mdash;The Report of the Committee
was ordered to lie upon the table, and no further
proceedings were taken upon it; it lies upon the table at
present.</p>

<p>10. Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>: On what day was it laid upon the
table?&mdash;On the 20th of May, the day on which the House
assembled for business.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>11. Mr. <span class="smcap">Attorney General</span>: I think some of the members
of the Committee would like to have some account of
what took place in the interval between the time when Mr.
Bradlaugh claimed to make the affirmation, and the time
when he appeared at the table to take the Oath?&mdash;Mr.
Bradlaugh presented himself at the table to be sworn on
the 21st of May, the day after the receipt of the Report
from the Committee; and if the Committee would desire it,
I can read from the Minutes what took place upon that
occasion. &#8220;Mr. Bradlaugh, returned as one of the Members
for the borough of Northampton, came to the table to take
and subscribe the Oath, and the Clerk was proceeding to
administer the same to him, when Sir Henry Drummond
Wolff, Member for Portsmouth, rose to take objection
thereto, and submit a motion to the House; whereupon Mr.
Speaker directed Mr. Bradlaugh to withdraw.&#8221; And then,
as the Committee are aware, several proceedings occurred,
which extended over some days: the Committee will scarcely
desire them to be read.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: Those proceedings are really stated in
the Order of Reference to this Committee?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>13. Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>: At what date did this Parliament meet
for the first time?&mdash;On Thursday, the 29th of April.</p>

<p>14. And on what day did Mr. Bradlaugh claim to make
the affirmation?&mdash;On Monday, the 3rd of May.</p>

<p>15. The swearing of Members had been going on in the
meantime, had it not?&mdash;The swearing of Members began on
Friday, the 30th of April.</p>

<p>16. You are acquainted with Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s appearance;
are you yourself aware whether he had been in the House
during the swearing of Members on any of the intervening
days?&mdash;He had been about the House, unquestionably.</p>

<p>17. Mr. Serjeant <span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Mr. Bradlaugh was present, I
believe, and voted when the Speaker was elected?&mdash;Yes;
none of the members had then been sworn.</p>

<p>18. <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: Since this Committee has been appointed
have you made a search into the Journals of the House for
any precedents which bear upon the question before the
Committee?&mdash;Yes, I directed the Clerk of the Journals to
make a search for every precedent which would tend to
illustrate the jurisdiction and proceedings of the House in
regard to the taking of oaths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>19. What is the result of the search?&mdash;The result of that
search is the paper which is upon the table to-day, and in
the hands of all the Members of the Committee.</p>

<p>20. I see that one of those is a precedent of a Member
disabled for having sat in the House without taking the
Oath; then there is a precedent of a Member being admitted
to sit without taking the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy;
then there are precedents of Members being discharged for
declining to take the Oath; then there is a precedent of a
Member, being a Quaker, refusing to take the Oath; then
there is a precedent of a Member expelled for absconding,
and not taking the Oath; then there is a precedent of a
Member refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy; then
there is a precedent of a Member, being a Quaker,
claiming to make an affirmation; then there are precedents
of Members omitting the words in the Oath of Abjuration,
&#8220;on the true faith of a Christian;&#8221; and lastly, the precedent
of a Member stating that he had a conscientious objection
to take the Oath. I should like to ask whether there is any
precedent amongst those of a member coming to the table
and stating that he was ready to take the Oath, and any
objection being taken to him in consequence of that statement?&mdash;No,
there is no precedent to that effect, unless it
might be argued that the case of Mr. O&#8217;Connell, in 1829,
was, to a certain extent, analogous. He claimed, as the
Committee are aware, to take the Oath recently provided
by the Catholic Relief Act, and which, he contended, was
the oath that he was entitled to take; it was a question of
law whether that was the oath which he could take.</p>

<p>21. In that case he refused to take the old oath, and he
offered to take the new oath under the Catholic Relief Act?&mdash;That
is so.</p>

<p>22. And the House refused, I believe, to allow him to
take that oath?&mdash;That was the case. I may state briefly
that these precedents may generally be divided into three
classes: first, cases of refusal to take the oath; secondly,
claims to make an affirmation instead of taking the oath;
and thirdly, claims to omit a portion of the Oath of Abjuration.
With one or two exceptional cases, those three
classes comprehend all the cases which have been laid before
the Committee.</p>

<p>23. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span> (through the Committee): I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
like to ask upon that whether the case of Daniel O&#8217;Connell
was not a case of absolute refusal by the Member to take
the oath required by law?&mdash;I think the best way will be,
perhaps, to read the precedent from this paper, and then any
inference can be drawn from it. It is at page 5. &#8220;Precedent
of Member refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy; Daniel
O&#8217;Connell, Esq., professing the Roman Catholic religion,
returned knight of the shire for the county of Clare, being
introduced in the usual manner, for the purpose of taking
his seat, produced at the table a certificate of his having
been sworn before two of the deputies appointed by the
Lord Stewart, whereupon the Clerk tendered to him the
Oaths of Allegiance, Supremacy, and Abjuration; upon
which Mr. O&#8217;Connell stated that he was ready to take the
Oaths of Allegiance and Abjuration, but that he could not
take the Oath of Supremacy, and claimed the privilege of
being allowed to take the oath set forth in the Act passed
in the present Session of Parliament &#8216;for the relief of His
Majesty&#8217;s Roman Catholic subjects&#8217;; whereupon the Clerk
having stated the matter to Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker informed
Mr. O&#8217;Connell that, according to his interpretation
of the law, it was incumbent upon Mr. O&#8217;Connell to take
the Oaths of Allegiance, Supremacy and Abjuration, and
that the provisions of the new act applied only to Members
returned after the commencement of the said Act, except in
so far as regarded the repeal of the declaration against
transubstantiation; And that Mr. O&#8217;Connell must withdraw
unless he were prepared to take the Oaths of Allegiance,
Supremacy, and Abjuration. Whereupon Mr.
O&#8217;Connell withdrew. Motion, That Mr. O&#8217;Connell be
called back and heard at the table. Debate arising, a
Member stated that he was requested by Mr. O&#8217;Connell to
desire that he might be heard. Debate adjourned. Resolved,
That Mr. O&#8217;Connell, the Member for Clare, be
heard at the bar, by himself, his counsel or agents, in
respect of his claim to sit and vote in Parliament without
taking the Oath of Supremacy. Mr. O&#8217;Connell was called
in and heard accordingly: and being withdrawn; Resolved,
That it is the opinion of this House that Mr. O&#8217;Connell,
having been returned a Member of this House before the
commencement of the Act passed in this Session of Parliament
&#8216;for the relief of His Majesty&#8217;s Roman Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
subjects,&#8217; is not entitled to sit or vote in this House unless
he first take the Oath of Supremacy. Ordered, That Mr.
O&#8217;Connell do attend the House this day, and that Mr.
Speaker do then communicate to him the said resolution, and
ask him whether he will take the Oath of Supremacy. And
the House being informed that Mr. O&#8217;Connell attended at the
door, he was called to the Bar, and Mr. Speaker communicated
to him the resolution of the House of yesterday, and the order
thereon, as followeth.&#8221; Then the resolution and the order
are repeated. &#8220;And then Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the
said order, asked Mr. O&#8217;Connell whether he would take the
said Oath of Supremacy? Whereupon Mr. O&#8217;Connell
requested to see the said Oath, which being shown to him
accordingly, Mr. O&#8217;Connell stated that the said Oath contained
one proposition which he knew to be false, and
another proposition which he believed to be untrue; and
that he therefore refused to take the said Oath of Supremacy.
And then Mr. O&#8217;Connell was directed to withdraw,
and he withdrew accordingly;&#8221; and then a new writ was
ordered.</p>

<p>24. Mr. <span class="smcap">John Bright</span>: Were those oaths separate oaths?&mdash;Yes,
they were three separate oaths.</p>

<p>25. And they require three separate acts in taking them?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>26. Mr. <span class="smcap">Attorney General</span>: I think the result is that
the House first determined that the Oath of Supremacy
which ought to be taken by Mr. O&#8217;Connell was the old
oath, and not the oath under the Catholic Relief Act?&mdash;Clearly.</p>

<p>27. And having determined that it was the old oath that
required to be taken, Mr. O&#8217;Connell refused to take it?&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<p>28. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span> (through the Committee): Have you
searched for any precedent affecting the taking of the oath
by a Member alleged to be disqualified or ineligible; has
your attention been called to the case of John Horne
Tooke, in Volume 35 of Parliamentary History, in
the year 1801, commencing at page 956?&mdash;Not in respect
of any question relating to oaths: it is not amongst these
precedents.</p>

<p>29. As a fact, was Mr. John Horne Tooke&#8217;s capacity to
sit in the House challenged in this case?&mdash;Yes, as being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in Holy Orders, but not in relation to any question of taking
the oath.</p>

<p>30. The next question that I have to ask is whether your
attention has been called to the case of the alleged ineligibility
of Francis Bacon, the King&#8217;s Attorney General, in
1614, cited in the Commons Journal, Volume I., pp. 459
and 460?&mdash;No, my attention has not been directed to any
questions of incapacity: it has been confined to questions
arising out of the taking of the oaths prescribed by law.</p>

<p>31. There is one other question that I should like to ask,
and that is whether your attention has been called to any
case in which the House has discussed and dealt with the
election of a Member, before that Committee was sworn?&mdash;With
regard to the Jews, that would apply to Baron Rothschild
and to Alderman Salomons.</p>

<p>32. I do not mean a case of a Member refusing to be
sworn, but a case in which the House has dealt with the
election before the Member had been sworn; has your
attention been called to that?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>33. There is one case, the case of John Wilkes; the
cases of O&#8217;Donovan Rossa and Mitchell were cases of legal
disability; has your attention been called to any case in
which the House has dealt with the election of a Member
before he was sworn except for statutory disability?&mdash;Sir
John Leedes sat in the House without having taken the
Oath, and therefore he had clearly vacated his seat, and a
new writ was issued.</p>

<p>34. I mean a case in which the Member has not been
sworn, and in which there has been a discussion upon his
eligibility outside the precedents which you have handed in;
I refer to the case of John Wilkes, which is to be found
in 38 Commons Journals, p. 977, and Cavendish&#8217;s Parliamentary
Debates, Volume I., extending over many hundred
pages, commencing at 827. May I ask Sir Erskine May
whether the practice has not been that when a Member
appears to take the Oaths within the limited time, all other
business is immediately to cease and not to be resumed until
he has sworn and has subscribed the roll?&mdash;That was the
old practice, but it has been superseded by a recent Standing
Order under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866, and the
rule is now different; Members can be sworn until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
commencement of public business and afterwards; but no
debate or business may be interrupted for that purpose.</p>

<p>35. That is not quite the question that I wish to put; the
question that I wish to put is whether it is not now and has
not always been the practice of the House that within a
limited time, whatever that time may be, if a Member
appears to take the oaths all other business is immediately to
cease and not to be resumed until he has been sworn and
has subscribed the Roll?&mdash;That was the old practice, when
the oaths were required to be taken before four o&#8217;clock, but
it has since been altered. This is the present Standing
Order under which the oaths are administered, and this
order was made in pursuance of the Parliamentary Oaths
Act of 1866: &#8220;That Members may take and subscribe the
Oath required by law at any time during the sitting of the
House before the Orders of the Day and Notices of Motions
have been entered upon, or after they have been disposed
of, but no debate or business shall be interrupted for that
purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>36. Then I again repeat my question, whether the practice
has not been that a Member so appearing under the Standing
Order just read to take the oath, all other business is immediately
to cease and not to be resumed until he has been
sworn and has subscribed the Roll?&mdash;I have already stated
that such was the old practice, which has been distinctly and
specifically superseded by the last Standing Order, which is
now in force.</p>

<p>37. Is that the Standing Order which you have just read?&mdash;Yes,
that is the Standing Order now in force.</p>

<p>38. Of course it will be a matter for argument whether
it has altered it or not, but is there any other Order altering
this practice except the one which you have just read?&mdash;There
is no other Standing Order, and that Standing Order
was made, as I have already stated, in pursuance of the
Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866, which authorised the
House to make regulations with regard to the swearing
of Members.</p>

<p>39. But except so far as it may have been altered by the
Standing Order which you have just read, was the practice
that a Member appearing to take the oath all other business
was to cease, and not to be resumed until he had sworn and
subscribed the Roll?&mdash;Yes, certainly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>40. Mr. <span class="smcap">Attorney General</span>: The present Standing
Order is dated the 30th April, 1866, is it not?&mdash;It is.</p>

<p>41. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span> (through the Committee): Are you
aware that the House has refused to make any inquiry as to
what is consistent, or what is not consistent with the Oath
of Allegiance taken by a Member?&mdash;I presume that the
reference must be to a case which arose in debate. That I
do not consider, in any way, in point in the present inquiry,
but the question was this: &#8220;In one case an attempt was
made to obtain from a Member who was about to bring
forward a motion, a repudiation of statements made elsewhere,
which were alleged to be at variance with the oath
he had taken; but the Speaker stated that it was no part of
his duty to determine what was consistent with that oath,
and that the terms of the motion were not in violation of
any rules of the House.&#8221; That was a point of Order, and
had no reference whatever to the taking of the Oath.</p>

<p>42. Mr. <span class="smcap">Attorney General</span>: What was the motion?&mdash;It
is in the 210th volume of &#8220;Hansard&#8217;s Debates,&#8221; 3rd
Series, page 252. It is at page 197 of my book, in a note.</p>

<p>43. Mr. <span class="smcap">John Bright</span>: In what year?&mdash;On the 19th
March, 1872; there is merely an incidental reference to it.</p>

<p>44. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span> (through the Committee): Are you
aware of any precedent for the dealing by the House with
the election of any Member not disqualified by statute or
common law, until after that Member had sat and been
sworn?&mdash;My attention has not been directed to any precedent
bearing upon that precise point, but I apprehend that
the fact of whether the Member had been sworn or not
would not interfere with any proceedings. For example,
under an election petition, if a Member&#8217;s seat were contested,
under the old system, the matter would have proceeded
in the usual way, without reference to the question of
whether the Member had taken the Oath or not.</p>

<p>45. But in such a case the Member would have been
sworn, and would have sat until the question was decided?&mdash;Not
necessarily; under the terms of the question I
assume that he had not taken his seat.</p>

<p>46. Are there not very numerous cases in which with a
petition against a Member for alleged statutory disqualification
that Member has been sworn and has sat until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
decision?&mdash;Unquestionably; there can be no doubt about it;
it frequently happens.</p>

<p>47. Then I ask whether there is any precedent whatever
for the House dealing with a Member&#8217;s election or his right
to sit, except in cases of absolute statutory disqualification,
until that Member has taken his seat and the oaths?&mdash;So
far as I understand the question, I should say that whether
the Member has been sworn, or not, the matter of his disqualification,
or of his right to sit would be open to the
decision of the House.</p>

<p>48. I am not arguing the point at the moment; I am
only trying to get at the fact. If you have not looked for
it, of course I cannot have it; but is there, so far as you
know, any precedent of such a thing ever having happened?&mdash;I
know of none; but I have not searched for any such
precedent.</p>

<p>49. Mr. <span class="smcap">Attorney General</span>: It would not appear, would
it?&mdash;I hardly know how it would appear; unless one&#8217;s
attention were specifically drawn to any case, there would
be no means of discovering it.</p>

<p>50. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span> (through the Committee): I will
ask whether that question was not raised in the case of
Wilkes, and whether it was not in the consideration of that
case fully discussed, and whether the House did not resolve
that any such dealing with a member was subversive of the
rights of the whole body of electors of this kingdom?&mdash;I do
not understand how that case has any bearing upon the
present question.</p>

<p>51. There are three cases: one of expulsion, two of
election annulled, and then ultimate reversal of the whole of
that and expungment by the House?&mdash;Yes, but that has no
bearing upon the present case. Of course, I am familiar
with the case of Wilkes, but not in connection with any
matter arising out of the administration of oaths, which is
the special matter referred to this Committee.</p>

<p>52. Have you had your attention called to the Journal
of the House of Commons, Vol. I., page 460, in which Sir
Francis Bacon, the King&#8217;s Attorney General, having sworn
to his qualification, which was challenged, the House said,
&#8220;Their oath, their own consciences to look into, not we to
examine it?&#8221;&mdash;That case is not one of the precedents that
we have collected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span>: They are entered extremely
curiously, and one can only take the decision. It begins
on page 459, &#8220;Eligibility of the Attorney General,&#8221;
and it does not show there that it is Sir Francis Bacon:
but I have learnt that by looking up the other records;
and there being then a statutory declaration which
lasted until a few years ago for all counsel, solicitors,
and practising men of the law, it was objected that the
King&#8217;s Attorney General could not sit; it appears
that he had to swear to his qualification, and the
question of his oath and of his disqualification, being
Attorney General, were put, and the House said,
&#8220;Their oath, their own consciences to look into, not
we to examine it,&#8221; and they left him in the House,
resolving that no future Attorney General should sit
in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: That was the case which was raised as
to whether the law officers of the Crown, who had for
certain purposes seats in the House of Lords, had seats
in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span>: Not quite that. There was an
obsolete statute of the 46th Edward III., which was
only repealed eight or nine years ago, but which does
not seem to have been attended to, by which all practising
barristers and solicitors were disqualified for
sitting for counties.</p></blockquote>

<p>53. Mr. <span class="smcap">Beresford Hope</span>: Wilkes&#8217;s precedent being expunged,
is it still legible in the Journal, and could it be
produced for historical information?&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<p>54. Major <span class="smcap">Nolan</span>: With regard to the evidence about
O&#8217;Connell, I think you stated that an Act was passed to
enable O&#8217;Connell and his co-religionists to sit in Parliament?&mdash;Not
to enable O&#8217;Connell to sit in Parliament, but to enable
Roman Catholics to sit in Parliament.</p>

<p>55. O&#8217;Connell was not allowed to take advantage of that
Act until he was re-elected?&mdash;No, because he had been
elected prior to the passing of the Act, and the Act was
clearly prospective.</p>

<p>56. Was the wording of that particular statute the reason
why he was not allowed to take advantage of that Act?&mdash;Certainly;
distinctly.</p>

<p>57. Would it be possible for the present or any future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Parliament to pass an Act which would enable a man who
had been elected previous to the passing of the Act to sit
in the House?&mdash;It is not for me to say what Act of Parliament
might be agreed to by Parliament, but that is quite
a distinct case. In that case Mr. O&#8217;Connell had actually
been elected when the Catholic Relief Act was passed, and
there was a clause in the Act which made its operation
prospective, and therefore distinctly, and, I believe, intentionally,
excluding Mr. O&#8217;Connell from the benefits of the
Act.</p>

<p>58. Then he was only prevented from taking advantage
of that Act owing to the particular wording of that particular
clause, and not owing to anything inherent in the House of
Commons?&mdash;Yes; the decision was founded upon a literal
construction of the words of the recent statute.</p>

<p>59. Mr. <span class="smcap">Whitbread</span>: The case of Mr. O&#8217;Connell was
this: that he declined to take the oath which was required
of Members of Parliament elected at the time that he was
elected, and that he requested to be allowed to take another
form of oath; he was ordered to withdraw, and the House
considered his case; is there anything that you have found
in the Journals or in the Debates to indicate that if Mr.
O&#8217;Connell had been willing to take the oath required of him
by the House, the House would have objected to his so
taking it?&mdash;Certainly not; they put it to him whether he
would take the Oath of Supremacy, and upon the face of
the Journal, it would seem that if he had taken that oath,
he would have been admitted.</p>

<p>60. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span> (through the Committee): After
John Archdale had claimed to affirm, did not the House
absolutely order him to attend in his place for the purpose
of being sworn, and tender the oaths to him?&mdash;Mr. Archdale
was ordered to attend, and the House being informed
that Mr. Archdale attended according to order, his letter to
Mr. Speaker was read. That letter is printed at full length
among the precedents. &#8220;And the several statutes qualifying
persons to come into and sit and vote in this House
were read, viz., of the 30 Car. II., 1 Will. and Mari, and
7 &amp; 8 Will. and Mari. And then the said Mr. Archdale
was called in, and he came into the middle of the House,
almost to the table; and Mr. Speaker, by direction of the
House, asked him whether he had taken the oaths, or would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
take the oaths, appointed to qualify himself to be a Member
of this House; to which he answered, That in regard to a
principle of his religion he had not taken the oaths, nor
could take them; and then he withdrew, and a new writ
was ordered.&#8221;</p>

<p>61. Mr. Serjeant <span class="smcap">Simon</span>: With reference to what the
Honorable Member for Bedford has put to you just now,
Mr. O&#8217;Connell refused to take the Oath of Supremacy on
the ground that it contained matter which he knew to be
untrue, and other matter which he believed to be untrue?&mdash;Yes,
he so stated.</p>

<p>62. Thereupon he withdrew; but is there any precedent
among the Journals to show that a Member stating beforehand
that what was contained in the oath was untrue, or a
matter of unbelief to him, has been allowed to take the
oath under such circumstances?&mdash;No, this is the only precedent,
so far as I know, of that particular character. The
others are cases of absolute refusal to take the oath, or a
desire to make an affirmation instead of an oath, or to leave
out certain words of the Oath.</p>

<p>63. But is there any precedent where, as in the case of
Mr. O&#8217;Connell, a Member coming to the table of the House,
has made a statement such as Mr. O&#8217;Connell made, that the
oath contains matter which he knows to be untrue, or
believes to be untrue, and has been allowed to take the oath
afterwards?&mdash;There is no case to be found, so far as I
know; certainly there is none in any of these precedents.</p>

<p>64. Mr. Secretary <span class="smcap">Childers</span>: Is the precedent in Mr.
O&#8217;Connell&#8217;s case this; that on the 15th May Mr. O&#8217;Connell
said that he could not take the Oath of Supremacy, and
that, nevertheless, on the 19th, he was asked whether he
would take the Oath of Supremacy, although he had
previously informed the House that he was unable to take it?&mdash;Yes,
because he had been heard, in the interval, upon his
claim to take the new oath, under the recent Catholic Relief
Act.</p>

<p>65. But was not that a precedent for a Member who had
already stated that he could not take a certain oath, nevertheless
being afterwards asked by the House whether he
would take it?&mdash;It so appears on the face of the precedents.</p>

<p>66. I will put that question again more clearly; is it not
the case that, as appears on page 5 of the Paper which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
have placed before us, Mr. O&#8217;Connell on the 15th May
said, that he could not take the Oath of Supremacy?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>67. And that, nevertheless, on the 19th of May it was
ordered that Mr. Speaker do communicate to him the Resolution
passed on the same day, and ask him whether he
would take the Oath of Supremacy?&mdash;It was so.</p>

<p>68. Although the House was aware that Mr. O&#8217;Connell
had said that he could not take it?&mdash;Yes; but as I observed
before, in the interval he had been heard upon the question
of his right to take the new oath; and that, I think,
accounts for the fact that the question was repeated to him
as to whether, after the decision of the House had been
communicated, he still persisted in refusing to take the Oath
of Supremacy.</p>

<p>69. Mr. <span class="smcap">Watkin Williams</span>: Was not Mr. O&#8217;Connell&#8217;s
objection to taking the Oath of Supremacy an objection to
the truth of the matter sworn to?&mdash;Yes, certainly; and it
was an oath which no Roman Catholic could take.</p>

<p>70. It was the truth of the matter which he was asked to
pledge his oath to that he objected to, and he did not express
any disbelief in the binding character of the oath itself?&mdash;No.
Every Roman Catholic objected to take the Oath of
Supremacy; in fact, the Oath of Supremacy was expressly
designed to exclude them from Parliament.</p>

<p>71. Mr. <span class="smcap">Attorney General</span>: And in consequence of
the objection a new form of oath was put in the Catholic
Relief Bill?&mdash;Certainly, because the Oath of Supremacy
was intended to exclude Roman Catholics, and did exclude
them, and was known to exclude them.</p>

<p>72. Mr. <span class="smcap">Watkin Williams</span>: It was not his inability to
take the oath, but his inability to pledge himself to the
truth of what he was asked to swear to?&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<p>73. Mr. <span class="smcap">Staveley Hill</span>: I gather from you that the
House never asked O&#8217;Connell to take the oath after his
giving the grounds of recusancy?&mdash;Yes, that is so.</p>

<p>74. Mr. Serjeant <span class="smcap">Simon</span>: It appears that the Speaker
first asked him whether he would take the Oath of Supremacy,
and then he says, No, and gives those reasons?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>75. Mr. <span class="smcap">Pemberton</span>: In addition to Mr. O&#8217;Connell&#8217;s
having been heard after he had at first declined to take
the oath, was there not some further discussion in the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
in which other Members took part?&mdash;Certainly; those
Debates will all be found in Hansard.</p>

<p>76. Sir <span class="smcap">Gabriel Goldney</span>: His refusal to take the oath
in the first instance was accompanied by a claim at the same
time to take the new oath?&mdash;Clearly.</p>

<p>77. It was a refusal to take the oath accompanied by a
claim for a new one; afterwards he was allowed to be
heard upon that point, and then it was that the House,
having decided that he could not be admitted on the new
oath, he was asked if he chose to take the old oath, which
he refused to do?&mdash;That is a correct statement of the case.</p>

<p>78. Mr. <span class="smcap">Hopwood</span>: With regard to the point of the
Standing Orders as to which Mr. Bradlaugh has asked, as I
understand you, under the old practice, as pointed out in
Hatsell, and as we know it existed, the occasion of a Member
coming to be sworn caused all other business to cease?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>79. And then as you say, a Standing Order was passed
that particular times more appropriate should be allotted for
taking those oaths?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>80. But even though that may be so at the time of taking
an oath, no other business can go on?&mdash;Clearly not; it is
the sole business that is transacted at the moment.</p>

<p>81. No other business can be interposed, and nothing else
can be proceeded with but the oath of the Member?&mdash;Certainly
not; it is the business of the moment, and no other
business can interpose.</p>

<p>82. Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>: You have been asked by several honorable
Members about O&#8217;Connell&#8217;s case; in your opinion,
is there the slightest analogy between the facts and circumstances
in O&#8217;Connell&#8217;s case and those of the case now before
the Committee?&mdash;I see none myself, but I would rather
leave such questions for the determination of the Committee.
I have stated the case in print, and of course the points of
difference are matters of argument.</p>

<p>83. So far as you know, is there any precedent for
permitting a Member of the House of Commons to take the
Oath after he has stated in the House expressly, or by necessary
implication, that it will have no binding effect upon his
conscience?&mdash;There is no such case on record, so far as I
have had the means of ascertaining.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="center gap2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles Bradlaugh</span>, a Member of the House;
Examined:</p>

<p>84. <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: You were in the room, I think, when
Sir Thomas Erskine May gave that part of his evidence as
to a matter which was not on the Votes and Proceedings?&mdash;Yes,
but which took place upon the occasion of my first
coming to offer to affirm.</p>

<p>85. Is that accurately and fully stated?&mdash;It is accurately
and fully stated. I shall have to ask the indulgence of the
Committee if in any of the points which I press there seems
to be any undueness in the pressing of them, because, as far
as I can see, this is the first occasion on which such a matter
has arisen. In the reference which the Committee have to
deal with, I claim to be sworn and take my seat by virtue of
my due return, a return untainted by illegality of any description,
and in pursuance of the Statute of the 5th of
Richard II., which puts upon me the duty of coming here to
be sworn and do my duty under penalty of fine and imprisonment.
I do not know whether the Committee wish that I
should read the Statute. It is the second Statute of Richard
II.; it is on page 228 of the revised Statutes, Vol. I.; it is
a Statute of the year 1382. I submit that although a
Member may not sit and vote until he has taken the oaths,
he is entitled to all the other privileges of a Member, and is
otherwise regarded both by the House and the laws as
qualified to serve, until some other disqualification has been
shown to exist; and I quote in support of that Sir Thomas
Erskine May&#8217;s book, p. 202, that there is nothing in what I
did in asking to affirm which in any way disqualified me
from taking the Oath. The evidence that that is so is found
in the case of Archdale, on page 3 of the Precedents handed
in by Sir Thomas Erskine May, where, after John Archdale
had claimed to affirm, he was called into the House, and
Mr. Speaker, by direction of the House, asked him if he
would take the oaths; that I have never at any time refused
to take the Oath of Allegiance provided by Statute to be
taken by Members; that all I did was, believing as I then
did, that I had the right to affirm, to claim to affirm,
and I was then absolutely silent as to the oath; that I did
not refuse to take it, nor have I then or since expressed any
mental reservation, or stated that the appointed Oath of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Allegiance would not be binding upon me; that, on the
contrary, I say, and have said, that the essential part of the
oath is in the fullest and most complete degree binding upon
my honor and conscience, and that the repeating of words
of asseveration does not in the slightest degree weaken the
binding effect of the Oath of Allegiance upon me. I may
say, that if it would be more convenient for any Member of
the Committee to ask me any question upon my statement
as I go on, it will not interrupt me at all.</p>

<p>86. I think the Committee would rather hear you
through.&mdash;I submit that according to law the House of
Commons has neither the right nor the jurisdiction to refuse
to allow the said form of oath to be administered to me,
there being no legal disqualification on my part of which the
House can or ought to take notice, and there being on my
part an express demand to take the Oath, this demand being
unaccompanied by, and free from, any reservation or limitation.
I submit that there is no case in which the Oath of
Allegiance has been refused to any Member respectfully and
unreservedly tendering himself to be sworn. I submit that
any Member properly presenting himself to be sworn, and not
refusing to be sworn, is entitled to be sworn, and to take
his seat without interruption, and that the discussion of any
disqualification or ineligibility must in such case, according
to the practice and precedent of Parliament, take place after
the Member has taken his seat; and I quote in support of
that John Horne Tooke&#8217;s case, which came before the
House in 1801. It was alleged that John Horne Tooke
was ineligible because he was an ordained clergyman of the
Church of England. There he was allowed to take the
oaths first, and after he had taken the oaths Earl Temple
rose and said (I am quoting from page 956 of the Parliamentary
History, Volume 35), that he observed a gentleman
who had just retired from the table after having taken the
Oaths whom he conceived to be incapable of having a seat
in the House in consequence of his having taken priest&#8217;s
orders, and been inducted into a living. Earl Temple
agreed he would wait to see if a petition were presented against
him, and if not he should move a resolution upon the subject;
and ultimately a resolution was moved that John
Horne Tooke was ineligible. The House allowed John
Horne Tooke to sit, but declared clergymen for the future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to be ineligible for sitting. I rely upon that as showing
that the proper course to be pursued, supposing that any
Member should think that I am ineligible, is to wait until
I have been sworn and have taken my seat, and then to
challenge it; and that this is clear, because if it were not
so it would be possible for the first 41 Members sworn or
for a majority of that 41, that is, for 21 Members to hinder
the swearing of all Members coming later to the table without
any remedy on the part of the Members aggrieved; and
I submit, with great respect for the evidence of Sir Thomas
Erskine May, that he has misapprehended the force of the
Standing Order that he read to you. Hatsell&#8217;s Precedents,
Volume II., page 90, declares distinctly that when a Member
appears to take the oaths within a limited time, all
other business is immediately to cease, and not to be resumed
until he has been sworn and has subscribed the Roll; and
with great submission to Sir Thomas Erskine May, there is
no word in the Standing Order which he quoted as altering
and changing that practice, which does so alter and change
it. All that the Standing Order does is to specify the time
and the manner in which the Members might come to the
table to be sworn, which had not been hitherto specified;
but it does not in any way deal with what was to happen
when they did come to the table to be sworn. And if the
Committee would permit me respectfully to submit, it would
be most dangerous to the House if it were not so. The
first batch of Members called over by the Clerk of the
House are sworn, and they may then, if the contention
raised upon the Standing Order quoted by Sir Thomas
Erskine May be correct, prevent every other Member being
sworn, if there be more than 40. They may fulfil all the
duties of a House of Commons, and do what they please,
without any remedy, as the matter stands; every election
might be declared null and void, and every one sent back to
their constituencies one after another. I submit also that
the case of the Attorney General, Sir Francis Bacon,
Volume I. of the Commons Journal, page 459, is also a
precedent in the same direction. I am obliged to tell the
Committee that I cannot quote it with the same reliance that
I can put upon Horne Tooke&#8217;s case, for the notes seem to
have been taken, I will not say irregularly, but they do not
seem to convey the whole of what took place, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
I can only deal with the result. Sir H. Hobart is quoted as
being &#8220;the only attorney that hath been in this House;&#8221;
and then there arises a discussion, some of which does not
seem to me to be material, as to whether the then Attorney
General could sit or not, and I find in the returns that the
Attorney General at that date was Sir Francis Bacon,
who, three days after this discussion, elected to sit for
the University of Cambridge, and although I have not
the legal evidence, because the returns are incomplete
for that year, as he elected to sit for the University
of Cambridge, the probability is that he had also been
returned for a county. There was then a Statute of the
46th Edward III., which has only recently been repealed,
which made a practising man of the law absolutely ineligible;
and it also appears that there was some oath of qualification,
of which I have not been able to find the words, which was
then taken by a Member coming to the table; and it
appears here that the Oath was alleged in the course of the
discussion, and two things were said which I press upon the
attention of the Committee; one, that the precedents to
disable a Member ought to be shown on the side of those
who seek to disable (it is not written so lengthily as that;
the words are, &#8220;The precedents to disable him ought to be
showed on the other side&#8221;), and the other is, &#8220;Their oath,
their own consciences to look unto, not we to examine it,&#8221; which
meant, as I submit, that the House did not constitute itself
into an Inquisition to look behind a man coming to take the
Oath, but that, subject to his being dealt with by law if he
had taken it improperly, or subject to a legal disqualification
being made clear to the House, they assumed his oath to be
properly taken. I submit that even Members absolutely
petitioned against and alleged to be disqualified or ineligible
by law, are always allowed to be sworn when they come to
the table to be sworn and to sit pending the decision of the
petition. The only cases which I have found of absolute
legal disqualification in which the Member&#8217;s election was
annulled before he had entered the House, are the cases of
Mitchell and O&#8217;Donovan Rossa (both of whom were away),
and the case of John Wilkes, who was physically incapacitated
from taking the oath from the act that he was in the
custody of the law at the time, and those who held him
would not have permitted him to come to the table to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
sworn. Those are the only cases even with an allegation of
an absolute disqualification in the case of O&#8217;Donovan Rossa
and Mitchell, and of a disqualification alleged, but not
admitted, and not legal, not statutory, in the case of Wilkes,
that I have been able to find; and in Wilkes&#8217;s case the
House has solemnly decided that it did wrong there, and I
submit that it ought not to do it again. But here the return
is not questioned. It is not pretended that there has been
a single circumstance of illegality connected with the
election, the sole point being, Am I qualified to sit? If I
am qualified to sit, I have the duty to take the Oath, and the
House has neither the right nor the jurisdiction to refuse the
Oath to me, nor to interrupt me in the taking of it. If my
qualification or eligibility to sit is to be discussed, the precedent
for the proper mode of discussing that qualification
is in Horne Tooke&#8217;s case, and rightly so, because then I
have the opportunity from my place in the House of defending
myself, and of correcting any misstatements that may
possibly be urged by Members who may be too anxious that
I should not sit, supposing in any other House of Commons
it should happen, and it then gives the Member attacked
fair play. While I admit entirely that the House has a full
and most complete right to expel any sitting Member, and
this in its own discretion, and for any reasons in its wisdom
sufficient, I submit that it has never done this without first
calling upon the Member to be heard in his own defence,
and that that cannot possibly happen until the Member is
sworn and is sitting. I submit that while the House has
the right to annul the election of a person absolutely disqualified
by law, it has never, except in one case, that of
John Wilkes, claimed the right to interfere, and in that case
it ultimately expunged from its proceedings the whole of its
hostile resolutions, as being subversive of the rights of the
whole body of electors of this kingdom. I quote on that
the Commons Journal, Vol. 38, 3rd of May 1782. I do
not think that I should be right in troubling the Committee
with the very strong arguments used time after time by
Edmund Burke, Thomas Pitt, and others; but I want to
point out this, that in addition to the charge on which John
Wilkes was expelled from the House (and I am not questioning
his original expulsion), there were also charges introduced
against John Wilkes for his publications outside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
House. That will be found in 1st Cavendish, page 73 and
page 129, and they are charges far exceeding anything (if I
may judge from the reports which have even been put in)
in relation to any supposed publications of my own. None
of those charges were ultimately considered by the House to
justify the interference of the House with the choice of the
constituency. To use the words of Mr. Thomas Pitt, on
page 350 of Cavendish, words endorsed by the House itself,
&#8220;Nothing but a positive law can enable you to circumscribe
the electors in their choice of a representative, however, indiscreet
they may be in their choice.&#8221; I consider now on
what grounds is it claimed that the House of Commons has
the right and jurisdiction, following the words of reference,
to refuse to allow me to take and subscribe the Oath? Is
it for a disqualification or ineligibility existing prior to my
election and continuing down to the time of my election&mdash;I
mean a disqualification or ineligibility created by Statute or
existing at common law? No such disqualification is even
pretended. Is it for a disqualification or ineligibility of like
legal character arising since my election? No such disqualification
is pretended. Is it for conduct not amounting to
absolute disqualification legally, but conduct for which the
House has in its discretion exercised its rights and jurisdictions
by expelling a Member? It must be this, or it is
nothing. If there is neither legal disqualification prior to
my election, nor legal disqualification subsequent to my
election, then there must be such conduct not amounting to
absolute legal disqualification as would, were I a sitting
Member, justify the House in using its discretion to expel
a Member. But if that conduct be prior to the election,
then I submit that the constituency is the sole and sovereign
judge of the fitness of the candidate, such candidate not
being legally disqualified, and that where the chosen and
duly returned candidate is ready to perform his duties, this
House has neither the right nor the jurisdiction to revoke
the decision of the constituency; and that in the only case
in which the House did so interfere it afterwards solemnly
recorded that its conduct was illegal, as being subversive of
the rights of the whole body of the electors of this kingdom.
If the complaint against me is for conduct arising since my
election, then I submit that even if such matters justify my
expulsion as a Member, the point could only be raised after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
I had been heard in my place against the Resolution, and
that the matter could not arise until I have taken the Oath
and become entitled to speak, sit, and vote. Manifestly this
must be so, as otherwise it would always be in the power of
a majority to exclude from coming to take his seat any
Member to whom they might have an objection; and
although such a thing is, luckily, not probable now, there
have been times, even in the history of the House of Commons,
when a majority, even of election committees, as I
read in the Records of the House, have sought by mere prejudice
to exclude Members. It is, therefore, the more
necessary that at any rate a Member should have the right
to be heard in his own defence. I submit that there is no
precedent whatever for preventing a Member from taking
his seat and the Oath, on the ground of conduct not amounting
to absolute legal disqualification. There is no such precedent
to be found at all, and I have searched very carefully
indeed. I put the question to Sir Erskine May lest anything
should have escaped me, and I say absolutely there is no
precedent. Then I submit that it would not be consistent
with the dignity of the House to examine any statement
made by any Member outside the House, as to any of its
procedure, and that in fact the House has firmly refused to
allow a Member to be challenged as to whether or not
some of his extra-Parliamentary utterances were inconsistent
with his Oath of Allegiance; and here I should like
the Committee to come to a decision, because it would alter
and abridge my argument. If the Committee thought (I
will put a suppositious case) that, say there were some document
that they thought they had the right to take into consideration
here, then while I should object to that, I should
like to have the opportunity of addressing the Committee as
to that. So far as the evidence has gone, I have not heard
of any, except the mere statement in the House, only I
judged from a question put by an honorable and learned
Member that something was passing in his mind (which, by
the way, did not seem to me to be the fact) justifying a
question put to Sir Thomas Erskine May as to whether the
Oath could be administered to a man who had done something
either actually or by implication repudiating the effect
of that Oath. I have heard nothing in the evidence, so far
as it has gone, giving the slightest color or warranty for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
such a question. If there are any facts to be dealt with by
this Committee other than that, then I should like to know
the facts, and to argue upon them; but it would be only
wasting the time of the Committee to address argument to
any point which the Committee would not think it right to
consider; and I should be glad if, before going further into
my statement, the Committee thought it right to intimate to
me their view upon that.</p>

<p class="margl5">The Committee deliberated.</p>

<p>87. <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: I think the Committee would like to
understand from you the kind of objection that you are
anticipating before you proceed with your argument; as I
understood you, you took this kind of objection: &#8220;I wish
to know whether the Committee are going into any proceedings
external to the proceedings which took place in the
House, or will entertain the consideration of those questions,&#8221;
and that if they did so you would wish to be heard
upon that point; I understood you also to say that beyond
that general question as to any proceedings which may have
taken place as part of the transaction in any other place
than the House itself, you wish to know whether the Committee
would take such matter into their consideration; am
I right in supposing that to be the character of your
objection?&mdash;Not quite. Practically my question is this:
Will this Committee take any facts into consideration other
than those of which I have heard evidence given, and those
which have been stated by myself in the course of my
argument? If so, I should like to know, because I understood
the permission of the Committee to be that I should
address them at the close of the case before their deliberations,
and I should submit with all respect that the Committee
would not take one matter of fact into their consideration
to influence them in their deliberations which I had not
the opportunity of addressing them upon. If they have
finished, and if there are no facts except those which I have
heard to be dealt with, it enables me to turn out and eliminate
a portion of the argument which I have prepared.</p>

<p class="margl5">The Committee deliberated.</p>

<p>88. <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: The Committee have considered the
matter which you have submitted to them, and they request
me to inform you that members of the Committee do propose,
after your statement is concluded, to ask some questions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
you; but I have to inform you, at the same time, that you
will be invited, and are invited, to state any objections that
you may entertain to any such questions when put, and that
you shall have a full opportunity of addressing the Committee
after they have heard your answers to the questions
so put?&mdash;That will enable me to eliminate a portion of my
argument. I wish to submit to the Committee one observation
on the precedent of Daniel O&#8217;Connell, and that is that,
as a matter of fact, the evidence of Sir Thomas Erskine
May shows that he misapprehended that precedent. It was
a refusal by Daniel O&#8217;Connell to take the Oaths by law
required of a member at the date of his election. Between
the date of his election and the date of his refusal the law
had changed, but it had not changed (so the House interpreted
the Statute, or so the Statute ran, I do not know which)
at the date of his election. So that I submit that Daniel
O&#8217;Connell&#8217;s case is a case of a Member refusing to take
the Oath by law required; and I further submit that the
Parliamentary Debates will show that the words which
appear as being used by Mr. O&#8217;Connell on the 19th of May,
sufficiently expressed his reason for refusing to take the
Oath of Supremacy some days at least before the House
asked him again to take it. Then I have only two other
matters which I should wish to submit to the Committee.
One is that I have, neither directly nor indirectly, obtruded
upon the House, since I have been a Member, any of my
utterances or publications upon any subject whatever; that
there is no precedent, except in the case of John Wilkes,
for any reference on the part of any opposing Member to
such publications by any Member prior to the taking of his
seat; and that the ultimate decision of the House in John
Wilkes&#8217;s case is directly against the introduction by any
Member hostile to me of any such matter as a reason for
my not being allowed to take my seat. Finally, I most
respectfully submit that I have grave matter of complaint
that my privileges as a Member of the House of Commons
have been seriously infringed, and that the rights of the
electors, my constituents, have been ignored in the attacks
made upon me without previous notice to me; attacks to
which I had no opportunity of making a dignified reply;
attacks which, if the newspaper reports be accurate, were in
many instances based upon absolute misapprehension or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
misquotation of my publications, and in one instance at any
rate, based upon the most extreme misrepresentation of my
conduct. I thank the Committee for listening to me, and
I regret if my want of knowledge of the forms of the House
has involved my saying anything in a manner in which the
Committee would prefer that I should not have said it.</p>

<p>89. That is all you wish to state at present?&mdash;That is all
I wish to state at present upon the evidence as taken by the
Committee. If fresh evidence should be taken, I should
ask the permission of the Committee to have the right of
addressing them upon that.</p>

<p>90. The Committee will now proceed to examine you.&mdash;Before
any question is put to me, will you, Sir, tell me
when is the proper time to object to any question which I
may think I have the right to object to?</p>

<p>91. When the question is put, before answering it?&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Attorney General</span>: You will understand that
I am not in any sense cross-examining you, but merely
to clear up what took place in the House.</p>

<p>I am entirely in the hands of the Committee.</p></blockquote>

<p>92. We know from the Proceedings of the House that
you did at the table of the House make a claim, in the first
instance, to make affirmation instead of taking the oath?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>93. And we understand that you did so on the ground
that you were a person entitled to make affirmation within
the terms of the Evidence Amendment Acts of 1869 and
1870?&mdash;That was then my impression of the law, and that
was the claim which I made.</p>

<p>94. And I presume, of course, that at the time when you
made that claim you founded it upon the belief that you
were entitled to make affirmation in the House of Commons?&mdash;I
made that claim solely upon my belief that the
law entitled me to make it.</p>

<p>95. Then as regards your power to give evidence under
the Evidence Amendment Acts in courts both civil and
criminal, you of course put it before the House of Commons,
as a fact, that you were a person entitled in those
courts to make affirmation?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>96. And I presume that you were acquainted with the
terms of those Acts, the subject interesting you?&mdash;Quite.</p>

<p>97. Were you aware that if you yourself were called as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
a witness, it would be necessary before you were allowed
to make affirmation in a court, either civil or criminal, under
the Acts of 1869 and 1870, that two things should be established;
first, that you yourself objected to take the oath,
or that your right to take it was objected to by some one
else; and then, secondly, that the judge would be required
to satisfy himself that the taking of an oath by you would
have no binding effect upon your conscience?&mdash;No, that is
not my interpretation of the Statute, nor do I think it has
always been (although I think it has sometimes been) the
interpretation of the judge or other presiding officer dealing
with it.</p>

<p>98. Would you kindly explain your own view as to the
sense in which you read the statute of 1869, which says that
the judge must satisfy himself that the oath is not binding
upon the conscience of the person wishing to affirm, the
words being, &#8220;If any person called to give evidence in any
court of justice, whether in a civil or criminal proceeding,
shall object to take an oath, or shall be objected to as
incompetent to take an oath, such person shall, if the presiding
judge is satisfied that an oath would have no binding
effect on his conscience, make the following promise and
declaration&#8221;?&mdash;My interpretation is that upon certain
answers being given by the witness, the judge is bound
to take his affirmation, even supposing that the judge himself
should not be of opinion that the oath is not binding
upon him; and it has been decided so by the Court of
Queen&#8217;s Bench. In the case of <i>ex parte</i> Lennard <i>v.</i> Woolrych,
a man tendered his affirmation at the Westminster Police
Court, and the magistrate asked him (I am repeating from
memory, but repeating perfectly accurately the substance
of what appears in the affidavits filed in the Court of Queen&#8217;s
Bench), &#8220;Why do you object?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am an
Atheist.&#8221; The magistrate refused to allow him to give
evidence upon affirmation, and the court held that upon
hearing that answer there was enough under the Act, and
that the magistrate was bound to take the man&#8217;s evidence,
and issued a mandamus to compel him.</p>

<p>99. You will not suppose that I am arguing with you,
but as I understand that case the witness who tendered himself
having said he was an Atheist, the court held that the
magistrate was bound to draw the inference from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
assertion that the oath was not binding, and therefore to
let him make the affirmation?&mdash;That is so. Whether the
presiding officer did draw the inference or not, the court
held that he was bound to.</p>

<p>100. Then I do not think that there is much difference
between us; but I assume that when you come to the table
of the House of Commons, and asked leave to make affirmation
instead of taking the Oath, you were a person, as I
understand it, who, if you had gone into a court of justice
and made the same request, would have been held by the
presiding judge to be one upon whom the oath would have
no binding effect?&mdash;I did think so when I applied to affirm.
I do not think so since the Report of your Committee, for
your Committee has reported that the two oaths are entirely
different.</p>

<p>101. It is a question for you: do you draw any distinction
between the binding effect upon your conscience of the
Assertory Oath, as it is called, and the Promissory Oath?&mdash;Most
certainly I do. The Testimony Oath is not binding
upon my conscience, because there is another form which
the law has provided which I may take, which is more consonant
with my feelings. The Promissory Oath is and will
be binding upon my conscience if I take it, because the law,
as interpreted by your Committee, says that it is the form
which I am to take, and the Statute requires me to take it.</p>

<p>102. Pray do not answer this question unless you like:
am I to understand you that the binding effect upon your
conscience of the Oath depends upon whether there is an
alternative method of taking that which is to you equivalent
to the oath?&mdash;No, most certainly not. Any form that I
went through, any oath that I took, I should regard as
binding upon my conscience in the fullest degree. I would
go through no form, I would take no oath, unless I meant
it to be so binding.</p>

<p>103. Pray object if you do not wish to answer this question:
By virtue of what do you regard that assertion which
you make within the Oath as binding?&mdash;I have not caught
your question, if you will pardon me for saying so.</p>

<p>104. By virtue of what portion of what is contained in
the Oath do you feel that your conscience is bound; is it by
the mere fact that you repeat the words therein contained,
or is it by that which is contained in the form of the Oath?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>&mdash;Those
words, &#8220;I do swear that I will be faithful and bear
true allegiance to her Majesty Queen Victoria, her heirs and
successors, according to law,&#8221; are to me, binding in the
most full and complete and thorough degree on my
conscience.</p>

<p>105. If you read a promise out of any book or paper,
and said, &#8220;I promise so to do,&#8221; is there more binding effect
in those words that you have read than in the mere ordinary
assertion of a promise?&mdash;Yes, because this reading is by
law, and by the decision of your Committee intended to be
the form in which I pledge my allegiance as a Member.</p>

<p>106. Then if it were a form sanctioned by law, as in
the case of an affirmation, is there any more effect upon
your mind if you take it in the form of what we call an oath
than if you took it simply by words of affirmation or
promise?&mdash;If the form sanctioned by law ran &#8220;I
affirm,&#8221; or &#8220;I declare and affirm,&#8221; or &#8220;I solemnly and sincerely
declare and affirm that I will be faithful and bear
true allegiance to her Majesty Queen Victoria, her heirs and
successors, according to law,&#8221; that would be equally binding
upon my conscience.</p>

<p>107. Do you attach any express or particular meaning to
the words &#8220;I swear&#8221;?&mdash;The meaning that I attach to them
is that they are a pledge upon my conscience to the truth of
the declaration which I am making.</p>

<p>108. But a pledge given, may I ask, to whom?&mdash;A
pledge given to the properly constituted authorities, whomsoever
they may be, who are entitled to receive it from me.</p>

<p>109. Do you attribute any more meaning to those words
than a pledge to human beings around you?&mdash;I attach no
more meaning to those words than I do to a pledge to
human beings authorised by law to take such a pledge from
me under similar solemn circumstances.</p>

<p>110. But the solemn circumstances, I suppose, are the
mere mundane circumstances?&mdash;The statutory circumstances.
I meant &#8220;solemn&#8221; simply in the sense of being
the statutory circumstances; I meant to distinguish between
that and mere conversation.</p>

<p>111. I think we understand from your answers that you
do not attribute any more weight to the use of the words
&#8220;I swear,&#8221; and to the words &#8220;So help me God,&#8221; than you
would to an ordinary promise if it were given under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
same circumstances as those under which you gave that
promise in the House of Commons?&mdash;I conceive myself
entitled by law to distinguish, and I beg therefore to object
to so much of the question as deals with the words &#8220;So help
me God,&#8221; my objection being founded on the case of Miller
<i>v.</i> Salomons, in the 17th Jurist, and the case of the Lancaster
and Carlisle Railway Company <i>v.</i> Heaton in the 4th
Jurist, new series.</p>

<p>112. I presume by that answer you mean that &#8220;So help
me, God&#8221; is no part of the oath or promise, but merely the
form in which it is taken?&mdash;That is so; it is merely a form of
asseveration.</p>

<p>113. Will you confine yourself, then, to the words &#8220;I
swear&#8221;?&mdash;I will.</p>

<p>114. Do you attribute any greater weight or any meaning
to the words &#8220;I swear,&#8221; and to the fact of kissing the book,
beyond the words of ordinary promise?&mdash;Not beyond the
words of ordinary promise made under statutory obligation.</p>

<p>115. Then what greater weight do you attach to a
promise made under statutory obligation than to an ordinary
promise?&mdash;I would prefer not making any promise that I
did not intend to keep; but the law has attached a weight
to statutory promises, and a penalty and disgrace on the
breaking of them.</p>

<p>116. That is a consequence resulting from human action;
you do not attribute any other weight to such a promise
beyond what results from such penalties?&mdash;I object to that
question.</p>

<p>117. I will now go to another point. How lately is it that
you have claimed a right to affirm in a court of law?&mdash;In a
superior court or in an inferior court?</p>

<p>118. In any court where you have taken an oath?&mdash;Recently
in an inferior court, within a few days.</p>

<p>119. How lately prior to your claim in the House of
Commons?&mdash;Prior to my claim in the House of Commons,
about 12 months.</p>

<p>120. You had made a claim on several occasions, I
suppose, prior to the period which you have just mentioned?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>121. What steps, if any, were taken by the judge on such
occasions to arrive at the conclusion that the oath would
have no binding effect:&mdash;On the last occasion, by Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Justice Lindley, none. I presume he thought my claim to
affirm well founded, and he simply bowed his head, and the
clerk administered the affirmation after looking to him.</p>

<p>122. I suppose you made a claim to affirm?&mdash;When the
clerk brought the Testament to the witness-box I said, &#8220;I
desire to affirm,&#8221; and the clerk looked at Mr. Justice
Lindley, who just bowed his head (he happened to be the
presiding judge), and I did affirm.</p>

<p>123. Had you reason to think that Mr. Justice Lindley
was acquainted with any previous applications by you to
affirm?&mdash;I should think it possible, because the claim to
affirm has been the subject of considerable litigation by
myself in the courts.</p>

<p>124. Upon any occasion upon which the judge did make
inquiry, what was the nature of the inquiry?&mdash;The present
Lord Justice Brett, whom I remember distinctly challenging
me upon it when he was Mr. Justice Brett, said: &#8220;Why do
you claim, Mr. Bradlaugh?&#8221; and I perfectly remember my
answer, but I am just thinking whether I am not entitled to
say this: that happened seven years ago; I do not intend to
imply that there is any change or anything since, but I think
I am entitled to say to this Committee that it is hardly
within the limits of their reference to inquire into something
that happened in a law court between myself and a judge
seven years ago.</p>

<p>125. I should not have asked the question, but you have
stated in the House of Commons yourself, in order to support
your claim to make affirmation, that you have frequently
been permitted to affirm?&mdash;That is so.</p>

<p>126. And I think you gave the last nine or ten years?&mdash;Yes,
and Mr. Justice Brett&#8217;s question came within that time.
I hope you will not consider that I am putting the objection
unfairly. What I want to put is this: that the conversation
which took place on the occasion of my having affirmed
(and I repeat that I have affirmed before different judges)
being more or less informal, ought not to be the subject of
inquiry by this Committee. The fact is of record. Those
were all at <i>Nisi Prius</i>.</p>

<p>127. It was before a judge who would have to administer
an oath?&mdash;Quite so.</p>

<p>128. If you state that you really entertain an objection to
the question, I do not wish to press it myself personally?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>&mdash;I
have no objection to answering, except that I have purposely
tried to keep out of this discussion any question of
my views; otherwise I am quite in the hands of the Committee,
and if the Committee are disposed to press the
question I will give the answer, having made my objection.</p>

<p>129. I do not wish to go into the views generally entertained
by you, except so far as expressed by you that the
Testimony Oath had no binding effect upon your conscience?&mdash;My
answer applied to the Assertory or Testimony
Oath.</p>

<p>130. I am asking you what you stated when a Testimony
Oath was being administered to you; but if you
desire not to answer the question, so far as I, an individual
member of the Committee, am concerned, I do not
wish to put it to you?&mdash;I take the objection.</p>

<p>131. Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>: Can you recall whether within any
time since your right to affirm was first recognised in courts
of justice, you have taken the Oath?&mdash;Never; that is to say,
the oath as a witness.</p>

<p>132. Have you ever taken any oath since your right to
affirm was first admitted in courts of justice?&mdash;It only has
been my right to affirm as a witness that has been admitted
in a court of justice; I have under cover of that Act, but
I think illegally, affirmed as foreman of a special jury, but
I have considerable doubt whether the Act covered my
affirmation as a juryman.</p>

<p>133. With that knowledge now present to your mind, is
it the fact that the oath which you seek to take at the table of
the House is, if you are permitted to take it, the first oath
that you will have taken since you were permitted to
affirm in courts of justice?&mdash;It is the first occasion upon
which there has been any reason for my taking or not
taking the Oath of Allegiance since I have been permitted
to affirm.</p>

<p>134. Or any other form of oath?&mdash;My memory is not
quite clear upon that; I am not sure. There was a case in
which I took evidence as a Commissioner from America,
and I am not at all sure whether the completion of that
Commission was before or after the passing of the Affirmation
Act.</p>

<p>135. But since the passing of the Act?&mdash;I cannot quite
pledge my mind as to that; but except in that case in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
I was a Commissioner for taking some evidence in relation
to an American process, in which I may have done so, I
certainly have not.</p>

<p>136. Then am I to understand that you seek now to take
this oath with exactly the same meaning in your mind as
you would take the affirmation?&mdash;Which affirmation?</p>

<p>137. The affirmation which you originally sought to take
at the table of the House, the Promissory Affirmation?&mdash;I
seek to take the Oath of Allegiance just as I should seek
to take the Affirmation of Allegiance.</p>

<p>138. And do you attach in your mind no different meaning
to the word &#8220;swear&#8221; than you would to the word
&#8220;affirm?&#8221;&mdash;The law does not.</p>

<p>139. Do you, in your own mind, attach any difference to
the sanction?&mdash;I object that the question put to me asks
me to make a distinguishment which the law does not
make.</p>

<p>140. I do not wish to press anything to which you object;
do you desire to tell the Committee that, in your own mind,
there is no distinction drawn when you use the word
&#8220;affirm&#8221; and when you use the word &#8220;swear&#8221;?&mdash;To me,
on the Statute they have the same meaning; that is, they
are a pledge that what I put after those words is binding
upon me in the most complete degree.</p>

<p>141. I suppose you are aware of all the ordinary definitions
of an oath contained in the law books?&mdash;I am afraid
that would be saying more than I have any right to say.
I am fairly well read, but not sufficiently to say that I know
them all.</p>

<p>142. You know a great many of them, I suppose?&mdash;I
have learnt a few.</p>

<p>143. You said to my honorable and learned friend, the
Attorney General, that you regarded the word &#8220;swear&#8221; as
a pledge given to a properly constituted authority, and that
that was the meaning you attached to the word &#8220;swear&#8221;;
what do you mean by the &#8220;properly constituted authority&#8221;
that you referred to in that answer?&mdash;Whatever may be the
authority established by Statute for the purpose of taking
such an oath.</p>

<p>144. A human authority?&mdash;All authorities established
by Statute for the taking of oaths are human authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Any authority outside a Statute is illegal, and any person
administering such an oath is indictable.</p>

<p>145. You are aware of the meaning of the expression
&#8220;sanction of an oath&#8221;; what do you consider would be the
sanction of the Oath if you took it?&mdash;I am not sure that I
apprehend the meaning that is in your mind when you use
the words &#8220;sanction of an oath.&#8221;</p>

<p>146. I will read the definition which is contained in Mr.
Baron Martin&#8217;s judgment in the case of Miller <i>v.</i> Salomon&#8217;s,
where it refers to the case of Omichund <i>v.</i> Barker, as
reported in the &#8220;Law Journal&#8221;: &#8220;The doctrine laid down
by the Lord Chancellor (Hardwicke) (Omichund <i>v.</i> Barker),
and all the other judges, was that the essence of an oath was
an appeal to a Supreme Being in whose existence the person
taking the oath believed, and whom he also believed to be a
rewarder of truth and an avenger of falsehood, and that
the form of taking an oath was a mere outward act, and not
essential to the oath which might be administered to all
persons according to their own peculiar religious opinions,
and in such manner as most affected their consciences.&#8221;
You have listened to that statement?&mdash;Yes; and I have
also read the judgment of the Court of Error in the following
year, in which they say that the essential words of the
oath are those without the appeal, and that the words &#8220;So
help me, God&#8221; are words of asseveration, the manner of
taking the oath; but the words preceding them are, it
appears to me, an essential part of the oath; and in the
case of the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway Company <i>v.</i>
Heaton, it was held that the oath was completely taken
without the addition of that appeal.</p>

<p>147. I am not at all upon the words &#8220;So help me, God,&#8221;
which are the words referred to in the last case to which
you referred. I am now upon what contains a promise that
an oath is being taken when a man uses the word &#8220;swear&#8221;;
do you object to the definition which I have read?&mdash;I object
to that definition as overruled by the Court of Error in
its final decision in error, confirmed by a subsequent
decision of Lord Campbell in the Lancaster and Carlisle
Railway Company <i>v.</i> Heaton, when it was held that the
appeal was not a part of the oath.</p>

<p>148. <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: In both those cases I think the judges
in holding that view had reference simply to the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
&#8220;So help me, God&#8221;?&mdash;Simply to the words &#8220;So help me,
God.&#8221;</p>

<p>149. I think we are a little misunderstanding each other?&mdash;I
hope not; I want to be candid with the Committee.</p>

<p>150. Mr. <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>: I am not at all on the words which
that case went on of &#8220;So help me, God,&#8221; but I am on what
must be the essential distinction between an oath and an
affirmation; what, I ask you now, do you conceive to be the
essential distinction between an oath and an affirmation?&mdash;Following
the judgment of the Court of Error, repeated in
the other judgment which I quoted, I regard the essential
words of the oath as beginning with &#8220;I swear,&#8221; and
ending with &#8220;according to law.&#8221; I submit that it is
no part of my duty to draw any distinction, if distinction
exists, between the value of that and the value of an
affirmation, because the Statute has declared that they both
have the same value.</p>

<p>151. Do you consider that the taking of an oath implies
in the person taking it the existence of a belief in God, and
that he will reward and punish us according to our deserts?&mdash;That
depends upon the form of the oath; and since the
decision you quoted very many forms of oath have been
entirely changed by the Legislature.</p>

<p>152. Do you consider that if you use the word &#8220;swear,&#8221;
you appeal to a God?&mdash;I consider that I take an oath
which is binding upon my honor and conscience.</p>

<p>153. Without any reference to God?&mdash;I consider that I
take an oath which is binding upon my honor and conscience.</p>

<p>154. And supposing that you break that oath, what
what would be the consequences which you consider would
result to you?&mdash;I am not aware that the Statute has
provided that I shall declare my opinion upon those consequences.</p>

<p>155. Am I to understand that you decline to answer?&mdash;I
am objecting that the question is one which would not be
put in a court of law, and therefore, much more, should not
be put here.</p>

<p>156. In answer to the Attorney General, and in your
statement also, you used the words &#8220;essential part of the
Oath,&#8221; and the words of the Oath are, &#8220;I do swear that I
will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Queen Victoria, her heirs and successors, according to law;&#8221;
do you consider that all the words there present to your
mind are equally definite and clear meaning?&mdash;I consider
that the whole of those words are essential; I hold them to
be essential, and I submit myself to the construction which
the Court has put upon them.</p>

<p>157. Is there any word in the Oath in the Statute which
does not convey to your mind any clear and definite meaning?&mdash;There
is no word in that which does not convey to
me a clear and definite meaning.</p>

<p>158. And do you regard the words at the end of it, &#8220;So
help me, God,&#8221; as conveying any definite meaning, or merely
as a useless addendum to the promise?&mdash;I object that this
Committee will not ask me my opinion upon those words,
because they have been held by the highest court of law in
this realm, subject to appeal, to be no necessary part of
the Oath.</p>

<p>159. Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Jackson</span>: If your counsel were here I
should put to him this question, which do not answer if
you object; I will treat you as if you were your own
counsel; I understand your view to be that the Act of
1866 or the Act of 1868, gives you two alternative methods
of taking your seat, the one of affirmation and the other of
oath, and that it is open to you to take whichever of the
two you prefer; you prefer the affirmation, but it having
been decided not to be competent for you to make the affirmation,
you now propose to take the Oath?&mdash;That is
exactly my construction.</p>

<p>160. Now I will tell you my doubt, and perhaps you will be
good enough to tell me what you say upon it. It occurs to
me that these two alternatives are what lawyers call true
alternatives; that is to say, that each excludes the other,
and that the Committee having decided (perhaps you will
say erroneously) that you cannot affirm, you have by your
claim to affirm excluded yourself from the alternative claim
to take the Oath; are not the two mutually exclusive?&mdash;No;
the House of Commons decided that, fortunately for
me, and that saves me the trouble of thinking on it for
myself. When John Archdale applied to affirm, the House
held that he could not affirm, and they ordered him to take
the Oath.</p>

<p>161. Was that under the Statute which regulates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
present procedure?&mdash;No, but it was under the claim of a
man who thought that he had alternative courses, and who
refused to take the Oath.</p>

<p>162. That is the answer which you give to my doubt?&mdash;I
am not sure whether I have answered fully.</p>

<p>163. You do not condescend to any argument upon the
Statute, but you think that the one alternative is not exclusive
of the other?&mdash;I thought then, and subject to the
Report of the Committee against me, which I presume
binds me, I should still think that I have the right to
affirm, and if there were any way in which I thought I
could legally raise the question, I should try to do so.</p>

<p>164. But on the hypothesis that the decision of the Committee
was right, have you anything except the Archdale
precedent, from which you would argue that these two Acts
of Parliament do not create two mutually exclusive alternatives?&mdash;I
should simply reply that if that be so, and you
told me that I did not come within the one, I must come
within the other.</p>

<p>165. Mr. <span class="smcap">Staveley Hill</span>: I wish to ask you one question
with reference to what took place before Lord Justice
Brett (then Mr. Justice Brett), and, of course, if you think
proper, you will take the objection as you did to what the
Attorney General asked you: when Mr. Justice Brett
admitted you to affirm, what steps did he take with a view
to satisfy himself that an oath would not be binding upon
your conscience?&mdash;He put to me the question, &#8220;Why?&#8221;
and I gave to him three words as an answer, and these
three words apparently satisfied him, and he directed the
clerk to allow me to affirm. He put no question to me as
to whether the oath was binding upon me or not.</p>

<p>166. Have you any objection to tell the Committee what
those three words were?&mdash;The question put by Mr. Justice
Brett was, &#8220;Why?&#8221; I object to tell the answer, because
it would be an inquiry into a man&#8217;s religious opinions,
and Sir George Grey, in introducing the Parliamentary
Oaths Act in 1866, under which I claim, said, &#8220;We will
make no inquiry into any man&#8217;s religious opinions; let the
constituencies be the judges of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>167. But those three words, whatever they were, satisfied
Mr. Justice Brett that an oath would not be binding upon
your conscience?&mdash;I cannot say that, but they satisfied him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
sufficiently that he gave the clerk directions to allow me to
affirm.</p>

<p>168. When did that take place?&mdash;About eight years ago,
speaking roughly; it may be six or seven years, but I am
not certain about the time.</p>

<p>169. Was it reported in the newspapers, and is it
generally known?&mdash;I am not sure; there have been cases
reported.</p>

<p>170. Mr. <span class="smcap">Pemberton</span>: I wish to ask whether, since you
were returned as a Member of this House, and since the
Report of the last Committee, you authorised the publication
of a letter which appeared in the newspapers of the
21st of May in reference to the proceedings which have
taken place on this matter?&mdash;I ask that the question may
not be put to me, because I say that the House has already
decided that they will not put any inquiry to a member as
to what happens outside the House to determine what was
consistent with the Oath, or not.</p>

<p>171. Of course I do not press the question more than to
remind you that it had reference to proceedings which have
taken place in this House, and in a Committee of this
House?&mdash;Many things I have read (I do not know whether
they are accurate or inaccurate), speeches made by Members
referring to proceedings in this House, and to that Committee
in relation to this matter. To put it roughly, I should
submit that this Committee should not examine me as to
extra-Parliamentary utterances in reply to extra-Parliamentary
utterances. For example, one honorable Member,
Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, made a speech at Chichester&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>172. Lord <span class="smcap">Henry Lennox</span>: Not at Chichester?&mdash;The
papers said so; they may be very likely wrong, only it
shows still more, I submit, the force of the objection that
extra-Parliamentary publications in reply to extra-Parliamentary
utterances should not be the subject of questions
before this Committee.</p>

<p>173. Mr. <span class="smcap">Pemberton</span>: I will only again point out that it
was not in reply to an extra-Parliamentary utterance, but
had reference to proceedings in this House?&mdash;That assumes
what would be passing in the mind of the writer and what he
had in view in assuming it, and I decline to discuss any
subject of that kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>174. I am to take it that you decline to answer the question?&mdash;No,
I object to answer it. If the Committee think
that I ought to answer it I will answer it. I do not take a
legal objection. You quite understand that if the Committee
think I ought to answer it, I will answer it at once.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Committee deliberated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: The Committee have come unanimously
to the conclusion that the question put
by the honorable Member for East Kent ought to
be answered; but, in arriving at that conclusion, I
am requested to inform you what I will now read:
&#8220;That the Committee think Mr. Bradlaugh should
answer the question put to him by Mr. Pemberton, on
the ground that it refers to matters written by him
directly in relation to the question involved in the
order of reference to the Committee, and for the purpose
of expressing his views on such questions since
the claim was made by him to make the affirmation,
and before the appointment of the Committee.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>175. Mr. <span class="smcap">Pemberton</span>: I wish to ask whether, since you
were returned as a Member of this House, and since the
Report of the last Committee, you authorised the publication
of a letter which appeared in the newspapers of the
21st May, in reference to the proceedings which have taken
place on this matter, such letter being signed in your
name?&mdash;I think one of the members of the Committee
has a copy, which I handed to him; I have not seen the
print; and as I sent to all the newspapers a lithographed
copy, I prefer, for greater accuracy, to ask him to return
it to me. I hold in my hand a copy which I have no doubt
is the same.</p>

<p>176. <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: Do you object to that letter being put
in?&mdash;The moment the Committee decided that I ought to
answer that question, I had no reserve in saying that I left
myself in the hands of the Committee on it. I shall take
the liberty of wishing to address a word or two to the
Committee presently upon it. (<i>The letter was handed in.</i>)</p>

<p>177. Mr. <span class="smcap">Watkin Williams</span>: Do you propose to take
the Oath in the form given in the Statute of 1868, which
I will read to you: &#8220;I., A. B., do swear that I will be
faithful and bear true allegiance to her Majesty Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Victoria, her heirs and successors, according to law. So
help me, God?&#8221;&mdash;I do, that being the form in the Statute.</p>

<p>178. If you are permitted to take that oath, do you
intend the Committee to understand and believe that it will
be binding upon your conscience as an oath?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>179. In taking such oath, do you consider yourself as
appealing to some Supreme Being as a witness that you are
speaking the truth?&mdash;I submit that having said that I
regard the oath as binding upon my conscience, this Committee
has neither the right nor the duty to further interrogate
my conscience.</p>

<p>180. Sir <span class="smcap">Richard Cross</span>: You know of course that in
taking the oath in the form prescribed by the Statute, and
according to the custom of taking oaths, you will have to
kiss the Testament: do you attach the smallest weight to
the kissing of that book?&mdash;I attach the weight attached by
the law to the whole of the formula.</p>

<p>181. Do you attach the smallest weight to the kissing of
the book; do you think that the kissing of that book adds in
the slightest degree to the weight upon your conscience of
the words which you have already spoken without kissing
the book?&mdash;The law has said that the whole of that is to be
complete; I have not the right, therefore, to form an
opinion, or to formulate an opinion as to how much of that
I would leave out had I any choice in the matter.</p>

<p>182. Then do you attach any further importance to
the word &#8220;swear&#8221; in the oath itself, and to the fact of the
kissing of the book than if the word &#8220;swear&#8221; were written
&#8220;affirm,&#8221; and no kissing of the book were required?&mdash;I
have already said that I attach to the complete affirmation
the most complete binding effect on my conscience. If I
were allowed a preference, I would and still prefer the
affirmation. The law says that the oath is the form, and I
shall regard that form as in all its respects binding upon my
conscience.</p>

<p>183. Do you look upon the kissing of that particular book
as adding any more sanction than the kissing of any other
book?&mdash;I decline to do that which the law has not done;
the law has not split up the formula into parts, and
expressed an opinion upon each part separately, and I deny
the right of the Committee to ask me to do that which the
law has not done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>184. I will ask you one other question; do not answer it
unless you like?&mdash;I will not.</p>

<p>185. Do you think that the fact of the kissing of that
book has any relation to an appeal to a Supreme Being,
that you will, before Him, perform the oath which you have
taken?&mdash;The law has not required me, in any case, to
express an opinion as to that by itself. As to the whole
Oath I have expressed an opinion.</p>

<p>186. As regards the kissing of that book, would you look
upon that, so far as your conscience is concerned, as an idle
form?&mdash;The law has not required me to look upon it by itself,
and I dispute the right of the Committee to divide the
Oath into parts, and to take one part by itself without the
other. I have already answered that the whole of the Oath
when taken by me, and if taken by me, will be binding upon
my conscience.</p>

<p>187. But still you consider that a certain part of that
Oath, which the Statute imposes upon you the necessity to
take, is an idle, and empty, and meaningless form?&mdash;I have
never said so at any time.</p>

<p>188. But do you consider it so?&mdash;Most certainly I do not
consider the most considerable portion of it an idle and
empty form.</p>

<p>189. Some portion of it, I said?&mdash;I consider no portion
of the essential Oath an idle and empty form.</p>

<p>190. That is to say, that you would take the Oath because
the Statute says you must do so in order to take your seat?&mdash;That
is not so. I take the Oath because the Statute says
that I must do so, intending to be bound in my honor and
conscience by the oath I take. Every Member takes the
Oath because he must do so in order to take his seat, and
he could not take it without it.</p>

<p>191. But you do not think that the forms of the Oath,
as settled by law, adds anything to the binding of your conscience
further than saying &#8220;I solemnly affirm&#8221;?&mdash;Your
question presumes a form of thought which I have not
enunciated.</p>

<p>192. Mr. <span class="smcap">John Bright</span>: Do I understand you aright
that you have never said that the oath, as you propose to
take it, is less binding upon your conscience than it is supposed
to be on the consciences of other men?&mdash;I have never
said so; and in 1868, when I stood for election, there being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
then no form of affirmation possible for me, I had gravely
considered the question.</p>

<p>193. It is within your knowledge that some men, and not
a few men, who do not absolutely refuse to take an oath,
still greatly prefer to make an affirmation?&mdash;If it would not
be impertinent to say it, many Members of the House have
told me so since this question has been pending.</p>

<p>194. <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: I think you said, when I informed you
that the Committee thought that the letter should be put
in, that it was a subject upon which you wished to make an
observation?&mdash;I wish just to make the slightest observation
upon that, and upon one or two points that arose in questions
that have been put to me. If the Committee would
allow me to think for a moment I believe I can compress it
within very slight limits.</p>

<p>195. Sir <span class="smcap">Gabriel Goldney</span>: Your statement to Mr. Justice
Brett, I understood, you would think over?&mdash;No, that
my answer did not apply to. If the Committee think that
I ought to answer that question in the same way, the question
as to the three words, or rather four words, that I
answered to Mr. Justice Brett, I am quite in the hands of
the Committee, and I should not decline to answer them.</p>

<p>196. Mr. <span class="smcap">Staveley Hill</span>: The reason why I asked you
what they were, and where they were to be found if you did
not answer the question, was on purpose that one might
look for them, because it must be a matter of public notoriety
what the words were?&mdash;I should think it very possible. I
have taken my objection, and if there is even a thought in
the Committee that I had better answer the question, I
should not object to do so.</p>

<p>197. <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: What are the observations which you
wish to offer in consequence of your examination?&mdash;As the
House will now have before it the statement, I ask the Committee
in examining it to take it complete, not to separate
one or two words in it and to take those without the
countervailing words, and to remember that in this letter I
declare that the oath, if I take it, would bind me, and I now
repeat that in the most distinct and formal manner; that the
Oath of Allegiance, viz.: &#8220;I do swear that I will be faithful
and bear true allegiance to her Majesty Queen Victoria, her
heirs and successors, according to law,&#8221; will, when I take
it, be most fully, completely, and unreservedly binding upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
my honor and conscience; and I crave leave to refer to the
unanimous judgment of the full Court of the Exchequer
Chamber, in the case of Miller <i>v.</i> Salomons, 17th Jurist,
page 463, and to the case of the Lancaster and Carlisle
Railway Company <i>v.</i> Heaton, 4th Jurist, new series, page
708, for the distinguishment between the words of asseveration
and the essential words of an oath. But I also desire
to add, and I do this most solemnly and unreservedly, that
the taking and subscribing, or repeating of those words of
asseveration, will in no degree weaken the binding effect of
the oath on my conscience. I should like, finally, simply to
submit to the Committee, and especially to the honorable
and learned gentleman on the left of the Chairman, that
there has not been from the beginning to the end of this
matter, any declaration, either distinct or implied, that the
Oath if taken by me would be less binding upon me than
upon him; and I do submit to this Committee that this
House has never sought to inquire or to distinguish in any
fashion as to the religious views of its Members, except so
far as any of them have found themselves obliged by their
conscience to refuse to comply with some form that the
House has put before them. On the contrary, in the Lords&#8217;
protest on the discussion of the Promissory Oaths Municipal
Bill, Lord Holland and other Lords put it in the most distinct
fashion that no sort of inquisition and no sort of
inquiry ought to be tolerated involving any examination of
a man&#8217;s theological views. Lord Holland added, in words
better than I can command: &#8220;That there is no tribunal
which he knows competent to make that examination, and
that the purely secular and political duties called upon to
be performed were not such as to entitle that examination to
be made.&#8221; I thank the Committee for having listened to
me, and I submit myself to their decision.</p>

<p>198. <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: You mentioned some precedents which
you thought might usefully be added to the list of precedents
which we have already had: could you conveniently
add those cases?&mdash;Yes, I will do so.</p>

<p>199. <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: There was some reference, I think,
made to you by Mr. Whitbread, with regard to which you
desire to make some observations?&mdash;There was a point
urged by Mr. Whitbread upon the first Committee. I do
not know whether I should be in order in referring to it. I
thought it had been sufficiently covered by what I had said,
until I reflected upon it, and then I thought it had not. I
wish to submit to this Committee that it ought not to consider
that I claimed to affirm because I regarded the oath as
not binding upon my conscience, under the spirit of the
Evidence Further Amendment Act, 1869, for that Statute
runs: &#8220;If any one shall object to take an oath, or be
objected to as incompetent to take an oath;&#8221; and that it is
quite possible (perhaps wrongly, and undoubtedly wrongly,
as the Committee have so decided) that I might claim to
affirm, objecting to take the oath, and that the Committee
have not on the evidence here either the right or the duty
to assume anything more as against me in dealing with
it now. That is all I wish to put before the Committee.</p>

by the Members of the House.</p>

<p>He was called in accordingly; and came up to the table:
And Mr. Speaker acquainted him, That the House had
taken notice that he had been about the town a considerable
time; but yet did not attend the Service of the House; and
that he had direction to tender him the Oaths and Declaration.</p>

<p>Whereupon the Lord Fanshaw said, that it was true, he
had been about town a great while indeed; but had been in
the country, if his health would have permitted him; but
that he had been in a strict course of physick, and was in the
same condition still of physick and diet; but, however, that
since he was absent there was an Act of Parliament passed
for taking the Oaths; and he was not qualified to sit in the
House, in regard he was not satisfied to take the Oaths;
and therefore he could not appear.</p>

<p>And then withdrew.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Lord Fanshaw be discharged from
being a Member of the House.</p>

had endeavored to qualify himself to be a sitting Member

<p>&#8220;Upon the call of the House it will appear that I am
duly chosen and returned to serve in Parliament for the
borough of Chipping Wycomb, in the county of Bucks;
and, therefore, I request of thee to acquaint the honorable
House of Commons the reason I have not as yet appeared,
which is, that the burgesses being voluntarily inclined to
elect me, I did not oppose their inclinations, believing that
my declarations of fidelity, etc., might, in this case, as in
others, where the law requires an oath, be accepted, I am,
therefore, ready to execute my trust if the House think fit
to admit of me thereupon; which I do humbly submit to
their wisdom and justice; and shall acquiesce with what they

to the Clerk to be read; and the same was read accordingly,
and is as follows, viz.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Sir,</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis with pleasure that I embrace every opportunity of
returning you my acknowledgments for the good offices you
have done me, as often as the case of my unavoidable
absence has come under debate in the House. The repeated
experience I have had of your friendship in this point, encourages
me to hope for the continuance of them, which I
shall not offer to desire longer than the reasonableness of
my case shall appear to deserve them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg leave once more to represent it to you; and
through your assistance to the honorable House; whose displeasure
as it is a very sensible affliction to me, I should
be glad by any means in my power to remove. That as it
is impracticable for me to attend by the time appointed,
because of a very severe fit of the gout which I am now
afflicted with, and thereby give satisfaction to the House in
the method they have insisted on; I hope they will accept of
such as is in my power, and give me a favorable hearing
when I represent to them, that I was chose knight of the
shire of Cardigan when I was at 100 miles distant from it,
and had been absent thence for ten months before the time
of my election; which I was so far from seeking, that I
never asked a vote for it, and was chose even against my
inclinations.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not how far a man is obliged to stand to the
choice a county makes of him. Sure I am that I have
reason to complain of a force that has administered the
occasion of my disobliging the honorable House, by an
absence caused by infirmities, under which I labored at the
time of my choice, and which have continued upon me ever
since with the greatest severity, and with little or no intermission.</p>

<p>&#8220;In these circumstances I would fain hope that the
honorable House will rather blame the country&#8217;s choice
than him who has been unwillingly forced into a post, and
lies under the misfortune (for I flatter myself &#8217;twill not be
thought a crime) of not being able to attend the business of
it; and will therefore lay aside their displeasure, and
remit the sentence ordered against me.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am the rather encouraged to hope this, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Mr. Prynne, in his comment on the fourth book of Sir
Edward Coke&#8217;s Institutes, shows, from various records, that
incurable distempers have been constantly allowed by the
House for a just excuse of non-attendance; and upon
debates in such cases, no other punishment has been inflicted
than excusing the service of the Member, and ordering a
new writ for electing a person duly qualified, and capable of
attending the business of the House. This being the course
of Parliamentary proceedings in such cases as mine, which
I have now truly represented to you, and can produce
hundreds of witnesses to confirm, I hope that the unhappy
incapacity I am under of attending the service of the House,
will be thought to deserve no severer treatment than has
been usual in the like cases; and that my ready submission
to the honorable House&#8217;s pleasure in this point, will be a
means to restore me to their favorable opinion, and engage
you to promote the request of</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%">&#8220;Your most obliged and obedient humble servant,</p>
<p style="margin-left:60%">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Le Pryse</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aberllefenny, 18th February, 1715.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not how far the House in their last order about
me, might be influenced by any report of the messenger who
came down to my house; but to prevent misrepresentation
I think it proper to assure you, that within three days
after a very dangerous fit of the gout suffered me to come
downstairs, I came from thence hither to my father-in-law&#8217;s,
eighteen miles in my way to London. But the motion of
even so small a journey brought another fit upon me
immediately, with which I have been laid up here ever
since, and not having been yet so much as able to return to
my own house.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

upon the exclusion of Jews from Parliament, as by a Bill of
the present Session, intituled, &#8220;An Act to provide for the

<p>Baron Lionel Nathan de Rothschild, returned as one of
the Members for the City of London, came to the table to
be sworn; and stated that, being a person professing the
Jewish religion, he entertained a conscientious objection to
take the Oath which, by an Act passed in the present
Session, has been substituted for the Oaths of Allegiance,

upon the true faith of a Christian.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baron Lionel Nathan de Rothschild having again come
to the table, desired to be sworn on the Old Testament, as
being binding on his conscience.</p>

<p>Whereupon the Clerk reported the matter to Mr.

<p>Baron Lionel Nathan de Rothschild, Member for the City
of London, came to the table to be sworn, and stated that
being a person professing the Jewish religion, he had a
conscientious objection to take the oath in the form
required by the Act 22 Vict. c. 48. The Clerk having
reported the circumstance to Mr. Speaker, Baron Lionel
Nathan de Rothschild was directed to withdraw, and he
withdrew accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That it appears to this House that Baron Lionel
Nathan de Rothschild, a person professing the Jewish
religion, being otherwise entitled to sit and vote in this
House, is prevented from so sitting and voting by his conscientious
objection to take the oath, which by an Act
passed in the 22nd year of her Majesty has been substituted
for the Oaths of Allegiance, Supremacy, and Abjuration in
the form therein required.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That any person professing the Jewish religion
may henceforth in taking the oath prescribed in an Act
passed in the twenty-second year of her Majesty to entitle
him to sit and vote in this House, omit the words &#8220;and I
make this declaration upon the true faith of a Christian.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon Baron Lionel Nathan de Rothschild, Alderman
David Salomons, and Baron Mayer Amschel de
Rothschild, being Members professing the Jewish religion,
having come to the table, were sworn upon the Old Testa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>ment,
and took the oath, omitting the words &#8220;and I make
this declaration upon the true faith of a Christian,&#8221; and

<p><span class="smcap">David Salomons</span>, Esq., returned as one of the Members
for the borough of Greenwich, came to the table to be
sworn; and being tendered the New Testament by the
Clerk, stated that he desired to be sworn on the Old Testament:
Whereupon the Clerk reported the matter to Mr.
Speaker, and Mr. Speaker asked him why he desired to be
sworn on the Old Testament; he answered, because he considered
it binding on his conscience; Mr. Speaker then
desired the Clerk to swear him upon the Old Testament;
the Clerk handed to him the Old Testament, and tendered
him the oaths; and he took the Oaths of Allegiance and
Supremacy, repeating the same after the Clerk. The Clerk
then proceeded to administer the Oath of Abjuration, which
Mr. Salomons read as far as the words &#8220;upon the true faith
of a Christian,&#8221; which he omitted, concluding with the
words &#8220;So help me, God&#8221;. And the Clerk having reported
to Mr. Speaker that Mr. Salomons had omitted to repeat
the words &#8220;upon the true faith of a Christian,&#8221; Mr.
Speaker desired Mr. Salomons to withdraw. He thereupon
retired from the table and sat down upon one of the lower
benches, upon which Mr. Speaker informed him that, not
having taken the Oath of Abjuration in the form prescribed
by the Act of Parliament, and in the form in which the
House had upon a former occasion expressed its opinion
that it ought to be taken, he could not be allowed to remain
in the House, but must withdraw. And he withdrew
accordingly.</p>

<p>The House resumed the further proceedings.</p>

<p>Mr. Alderman Salomons entered the House, and took his
seat within the Bar: Whereupon Mr. Speaker said that he
saw that a Member had taken his seat without having taken
the Oaths required by law; and that he must therefore
desire that the honorable Member do withdraw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Alderman Salomons continued in the seat within the
Bar.</p>

now withdraw.</p>

<p>Whereupon Mr. Speaker stated that the honorable Member
for Greenwich had heard the decision of the House, and
hoped that the honorable Member was prepared to obey it.</p>

<p>Mr. Alderman Salomons continuing to sit in his seat, Mr.
Speaker directed the Serjeant-at-Arms to remove him below
the Bar.</p>

<p>Whereupon Mr. Serjeant-at-Arms having placed his hand
on Mr. Alderman Salomons, he was conducted below the
Bar.</p>

<p class="center">STATEMENT on the <span class="smcap">Oath Question</span> by Mr. <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span>.</p>

<p class="center">20, Circus Road, St. John&#8217;s Wood, London, N.W.,
20th May, 1880.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> elected as one of the Burgesses to represent
Northampton in the House of Commons, I believed that I
had the legal right to make affirmation of allegiance in lieu
of taking the oath, as provided by section 4 of the Parliamentary
Oaths Act, 1866. While I considered that I had
this legal right, it was then clearly my moral duty to make
the affirmation. The oath, although to me including words
of idle and meaningless character, was, and is, regarded by
a large number of my fellow countrymen as an appeal to
Deity to take cognizance of their swearing. It would have
been an act of hypocrisy to voluntarily take this form if any
other had been open to me, or to take it without protest, as
though it meant in my mouth any such appeal. I, therefore,
quietly and privately notified the Clerk of the House
of my desire to affirm. His view of the law and practice
differing from my own, and no similar case having theretofore
arisen, it became necessary that I should tender myself
to affirm in a more formal manner, and this I did at a season
deemed convenient by those in charge of the business of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
House. In tendering my affirmation, I was careful when called
on by the Speaker to state my objection, to do nothing more
than put in the fewest possible words my contention that the
Parliamentary Oaths Act, 1866, gave the right to affirm in
Parliament to every person for the time being by law permitted
to make an affirmation in lieu of taking an oath, and
that I was such a person, and therefore claimed to affirm.
The Speaker neither refusing, nor accepting my affirmation,
referred the matter to the House, which appointed a Select
Committee to report whether persons entitled to affirm under
the Evidence Amendment Acts, 1869 and 1870, were, under
Section 4 of the Parliamentary Oaths Act, 1866, also entitled
to affirm as Members of Parliament. This Committee, by
the casting-vote of its Chairman, has decided that I am not
entitled to affirm. Two courses are open to me, one of
appeal to the House against the decision of the Committee;
the other, of present compliance with the ceremony, while
doing my best to prevent the further maintenance of a form
which many other Members of the House think as objectionable
as I do, but which habit, and the fear of exciting prejudice,
has induced them to submit to. To appeal to the
House against the decision of the Committee would be ungracious,
and would certainly involve great delay of public
business. I was present at the deliberations of the Committee,
and while naturally I cannot be expected to bow
submissively to the statements and arguments of my
opponents, I am bound to say that they were calmly and
fairly urged. I think them unreasonable; but the fact that
they included a legal argument from an earnest Liberal
deprives them even of a purely party character. If I appealed
to the House against the Committee, I, of course,
might rely on the fact that the Attorney General, the
Solicitor General, Sir Henry Jackson, Q.C., Watkin
Williams, Q.C., and Mr. Serjeant Simon are reported in the
<i>Times</i> to have interpreted the law as I do; and I might add
that the Right Honorable John Bright and Mr. Whitbread
are in the same journal arrayed in favor of allowing me to
affirm. But even then the decision of the House may
endorse that of the Committee, and should it be in my favor
it could only, judging from what has already taken place, be
after a bitter party debate, in which the Government
specially and the Liberals generally would be sought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
burdened with my anti-theological views, and with promoting
my return to Parliament. As a matter of fact, the
Liberals of England have never in any way promoted my
return to Parliament. The much-attacked action of Mr.
Adam had relation only to the second seat, and in no way
related to the one for which I was fighting. In 1868, the
only action of Mr. Gladstone and of Mr. Bright was to
write letters in favor of my competitors; and since 1868 I
do not believe that either of these gentlemen has directly or
indirectly interfered in any way in connection with my
Parliamentary candidature. The majority of the electors of
Northampton had determined to return me before the recent
union in that borough, and while pleased to aid their fellow
Liberals in winning the two seats, my constituents would
have at any rate returned me had no union taken place.
My duty to my constituents is to fulfil the mandate they
have given me, and if to do this I have to submit to a form
less solemn to me than the affirmation I would have reverently
made, so much the worse for those who force me
to repeat words which I have scores of times declared
are to me sounds conveying no clear and definite meaning.
I am sorry for the earnest believers who see words sacred
to them used as a meaningless addendum to a promise, but
I cannot permit their less sincere co-religionists to use an
idle form in order to prevent me from doing my duty to
those who have chosen me to speak for them in Parliament.
I shall, taking the oath, regard myself as bound, not
by the letter of its words, but by the spirit which the affirmation
would have conveyed had I been permitted to use it.
So soon as I am able, I shall take such steps as may be
consistent with Parliamentary business to put an end to the
present doubtful and unfortunate state of the law and
practice on oaths and affirmations. Only four cases have
arisen of refusal to take the oath except, of course, those
cases purely political in their character; two of those cases
are those of the Quakers John Archdale and Joseph
Pease. The religion of these men forbade them to swear
at all, and they nobly refused. The sect to which they
belonged was outlawed, insulted and imprisoned; they were
firm, and one of that sect sat on the very committee, a
member of her Majesty&#8217;s Privy Council, and a member of
the actual Cabinet. I thank him gratefully that, valuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
right so highly, he cast his vote so nobly for one for whom
I am afraid he has but scant sympathy. No such religious
scruple prevents me from taking the oath as prevented John
Archdale and Joseph Pease. In the case of Baron Rothschild
and Alderman Salomons the words &#8220;upon the true
faith of a Christian&#8221; were the obstacle. To-day the oath
contains no such words. The Committee report that I may
not affirm, and protesting against a decision which seems to
me alike against the letter of the law and the spirit of
modern legislation, I comply with the forms of the House.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s</span> First Speech at the Bar of the House
of Commons, delivered June 23rd, 1880.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have to ask the indulgence of every member of
this House while, in a position unexampled in the history of
this House, I try to give one or two reasons why the resolution
which you have read to me should not be enforced. If
it were not unbecoming I should appeal to the traditions of
the House against the House itself, and I should point out
that in none of its records, so far as my poor reading goes,
is there any case in which this House has judged one of its
members in his absence, and taken away from that member
the constitutional right he has (hear, hear). There have
been members against whom absolute legal disqualification
has been urged. No such legal disqualification is ventured
to be urged by any member of this House against myself.
But even those members have been heard in their places;
those members have been listened to before the decision was
taken against them; and I ask that this House to myself
shall not be less just than it has always been to every one of
its members (hear, hear). Do you tell me I am unfit to sit
amongst you? (hear, hear, and Order, order.) The more
reason, then, that this House should show the generosity
which judges show to a criminal, and allow every word he
has to say to be heard. But I stand here, Sir, as no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
criminal. I stand here as the chosen of a constituency
of this country, with my duty to that constituency to do.
I stand here, Sir&mdash;if it will not be considered impertinent
to put it so&mdash;with the most profound respect for this House,
of which I yet hope and mean to form a part, and on whose
traditions I should not wish to cast one shadow of
reproach. I stand here returned duly; no petition
against my return; no impeachment of that return.
I stand here returned duly, ready to fulfil every form
that this House requires, ready to fulfil every form that
the law permits this House to require, ready to do every
duty that the law makes incumbent upon me. I will not in
this presence argue whether this House has or has not the
right to set its decision against the law, because I should
imagine that even the rashest of those who spoke against
me would hardly be prepared to put in the mouth of one
whom they consider too advanced in politics an arguments so
dangerous as that might become. I speak within the limits
of the law, asking for no favor from this House for
myself or for my constituents, but asking the merest
justice which has always been accorded to a member of
the House (hear, hear, and Order.) I have to ask indulgence
lest the memory of some hard words which have
been spoken in my absence should seem to give to what
I say a tone of defiance, which it is far from my
wish should be there at all; and I am the more
eased because although there were words spoken which
I had always been taught English gentlemen never said
in the absence of an antagonist without notice to
him, yet there were also generous and brave words
said for one who is at present, I am afraid, a source of
trouble and discomfort and hindrance to business. I measure
the generous words against the others, and I will
only make one appeal through you, Sir, which is, that if the
reports be correct that the introduction of other names
came with mine in the heat of passion and the warmth
of debate, the gentleman who used those words, if such
there were, will remember that he was wanting in chivalry,
because, while I can answer for myself, and am able to
answer for myself, nothing justified the introduction of any
other name beside my own to make a prejudice against me
(cheers and cries of Question and Order.) I fear lest the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
strength of this House, judicially exercised as I understand
it to be&mdash;with infrequency of judicial exercise&mdash;that the
strength of this House makes it forget our relative positions.
At present I am pleading at its bar for justice. By right
it is there I should plead. [The hon. member pointed to
the seats.] It is that right I claim in the name of those
who sent me here. No legal disqualification before my
election, or it might have been made the ground of petition.
No legal disqualification since my election&mdash;not even pretended.
It is said: &#8220;You might have taken the oath as
other members did.&#8221; I could not help when I read that,
Sir, trying to put myself in the place of each member who
said it. I imagined a member of some form of faith who
found in the oath words which seemed to him to clash with
his faith, but still words which he thought he might utter,
but which he would prefer not to utter if there were any
other form which the law provided him, and I asked myself
whether each of those members would not then have taken
the form which was most consonant with his honor and his
conscience. If I have not misread, some hon. members
seem to think that I have neither honor nor conscience. Is
there not some proof to the contrary in the fact that I did
not go through the form, believing that there was another
right open to me? (hear, hear, and Order.) Is that not
some proof that I have honor and conscience? Of the
gentlemen who are now about to measure themselves
against the rights of the constituencies of England I ask
what justification had they for that measurement? They
have said that I thrust my opinions on the House. I
hold here, Sir, the evidence of Sir Thomas Erskine May,
and I can find no word of any opinion of mine thrust
upon the House at all. I have read&mdash;it may be that the
reports misrepresent&mdash;that the cry of &#8220;Atheist&#8221; has been
raised from that side. [The hon. member pointed to the
Opposition side.] No word of all mine before the committee
put in any terms those theological or anti-theological opinions
in evidence before the House. I am no more ashamed
of my own opinions, which I did not choose, opinions
into which I have grown, than any member of this House is
ashamed of his; and much as I value the right to sit here,
and much as I believe that the justice of this House will
accord it to me before the struggle is finished, I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
rather relinquish it for ever than it should be thought that
by any shadow of hypocrisy I had tried to gain a feigned
entrance here by pretending to be what I am not (cheers,
and cries of Order.) On the report of the committee as it
stands, on the evidence before the House, what is the objection
to either my affirming or taking the oath? It is said I
have no legal right to affirm. I will suppose that to be so. It
is the first time that the House has made itself a court of law
from which there may be no appeal, and deprived a citizen
of his constitutional right of appeal to a court of law to
make out what the statute means in dealing with him.
There is no case in which this House has overridden everything,
and put one of its members where he had no chance
of battling for his right at all. Take the oath. It is
possible that some of the lawyers, who have disagreed among
themselves even upon that (the Opposition) side of the
House, may be right, and that I may be wrong in the construction
I have put upon the oath, but no such objection
can come. There is no precedent&mdash;there is, I submit
respectfully, no right&mdash;in this House to stand between me
and the oath which the law provides for me to take, which
the statute, under penalty even upon members of this House
themselves if they put me out from my just return, gives me
the right to take. What kind of a conflict is provoked here
if this resolution be enforced? Not a grave conflict in a
court of law, where the judges exclude passion, where they
only deal with facts and evidence. I do not mean that
these gentlemen do not deal with facts; but, if I am any
judge of my own life&#8217;s story, there have been many things
which I can hardly reckon in the category of facts put
against myself. I don&#8217;t mean that they are not right, for
hon. members may know more of myself than I do myself;
but, judging myself as I know myself, some of the members
who have attacked me so glibly during the last few days
must have been extraordinarily misinformed, or must have
exceedingly misapprehended the matters they alleged. It
has been said that I have paraded and flaunted some obnoxious
opinions. I appeal to your justice, sir, and to that
of the members of this House, to say whether my manner
has not been as respectful as that of man could be&mdash;whether
in each case I have not withdrawn when you told me. If I
now come here with even the appearance of self-assertion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
it is because I would not be a recreant and a coward to the
constituency that sent me to represent them; and I mean
to be as members have been in the best history of this
assembly. I ask the House, in dealing with my rights, to
remember how they are acting. It is perfectly true that
by a majority they may decide against me now. What
are you to do then? Are you going to declare the
seat vacant? First, I tell you that you have not the
right. The moment I am there&mdash;[the hon. member
pointed inside the House]&mdash;I admit the right of the
House, of its own good will and pleasure, to expel me.
As yet I am not under your jurisdiction. As yet I am
under the protection of the law. A return sent me to
this House, and I ask you, sir, as the guardian of the
liberties of this House, to give effect to that return. The
law says you should, and that this House should. And
naturally so; because, if it were not so, any time a majority
of members might exclude anyone they pleased. What
has been alleged against me? Politics? Are views on
politics urged as a reason why a member should not sit
here? Pamphlets have been read&mdash;I won&#8217;t say with
accuracy, because I will not libel any of the hon. members who
read them; but, surely, if they are grounds for disqualification
they are grounds for indictment to be proved against
me in a proper fashion. There is no case in all the records
of this House in which you have ransacked what a man
has written and said in his past life and then challenged
him with it here. My theology? It would be impertinent
in me, after the utterances of men so widely disagreeing
from me that have been made on the side of
religious liberty during the past two nights&mdash;it would be
impertinent in me to add one word save this. It is said
that you may deal with me because I am isolated. I could
not help hearing the ring of that word in the lobby as I sat
outside last night. But is that a reason, that, because I
stand alone the House are to do against me what they
would not do if I had 100,000 men at my back? (cries of
Oh). That is a bad argument which provokes a reply
inconsistent with the dignity of this House and which I
should be sorry to give. I have not yet used&mdash;I hope no
passion may tempt me to be using&mdash;any words that would
seem to savor of even a desire to enter into conflict with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
House. I have always taught, preached, and believed the
supremacy of Parliament, and it is not because for a
moment the judgment of one Chamber of Parliament
should be hostile to me that I am going to deny the ideas I
have always held; but I submit that one Chamber of Parliament&mdash;even
its grandest Chamber, as I have always held this
to be&mdash;had no right to override the law. The law gives me
the right to sign that roll, to take and subscribe the oath,
and to take my seat there [pointing to the benches]. I
admit that the moment I am in the House, without any
reason but your own good will, you can send me away.
That is your right. You have full control over your
members, but you cannot send me away until I have
been heard in my place, not a suppliant as I am now,
but with the rightful audience that each member has
always had. There is one phase of my appeal which I
am loth indeed to make. I presume you will declare
the seat vacant. What do you send me back to
Northampton to say? I said before, and I trust I
may say again, that this assembly was one in which any
man might well be proud to sit&mdash;prouder I that I have not
some of your traditions and am not of your families, but
am of the people, the people that sent me here to speak
for them. Do you mean that I am to go back to Northampton
as to a court, to appeal against you? that I am to
ask the constituency to array themselves against this House?
I hope not. If it is to be, it must be. If this House arrays
itself against an isolated man&mdash;its huge power against one
citizen&mdash;if it must be, then the battle must be too. But it
is not with the constituency of Northampton alone&mdash;hon.
members need not mistake&mdash;that you will come into conflict
if this appeal is to go forward, if the House of Commons
is to override the statute law to get rid of even the vilest
of members. Had you alleged against me even more than
against one man whose name was mentioned in this House
last night, I should still have held that the House cannot
supersede the rights of the people. But not as much is
alleged against me as was alleged against that man, in
whose case the House itself said that its conduct had been
subversive of the rights of the people. I beg you, for your
own sakes, don&#8217;t put yourselves in that position. I have no
desire to wrestle with you for justice. I admit that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
used hard words in my short life, giving men the right in
return to say hard things of me; but is it not better that I
should have the right to say them to your faces? If they
are within the law, let the law deal with me fairly and
properly; but if they are without the law, not unfairly, as
I submit you are doing now. You have the power to send
me back, but in appealing to Northampton I must appeal
to a tribunal higher than yours&mdash;not to courts of law, for
I hope the days of conflict between the assembly which
makes the law and the tribunals which administer it are
passed. It must be a bad day for England and for Great
Britain, if we are to be brought again to the time when the
judges and those who make the law for the judges are in
rash strife as to what they mean. But there is a court to
which I shall appeal&mdash;the court of public opinion, which
will have to express itself. You say it is against me.
Possibly; but if it be so, is it against me rightly or wrongly?
I am ready to admit, if you please, for the sake of argument,
that every opinion I hold is wrong and deserves
punishment. Let the law punish it. If you say the law
cannot, then you admit that you have no right, and I appeal
to public opinion against the iniquity of a decision which
overrides the law and denies me justice. I beg your pardon,
Sir, and that of the House too, if in this warmth there
seems to lack respect for its dignity; and as I shall have,
if your decision be against me, to come to that table when
your decision is given, I beg you, before the step is taken in
which we may both lose our dignity&mdash;mine is not much, but
yours is that of the Commons of England&mdash;I beg you,
before the gauntlet is fatally thrown&mdash;I beg you, not in any
sort of menace, not in any sort of boast, but as one man against
six hundred, to give me that justice which on the other side
of this hall the judges would give me were I pleading there
before them (loud cheers and cries of Order, amid which
Mr. Bradlaugh again bowed and retired).</p>

<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s</span> Second Speech at the Bar of the House
of Commons, delivered April 28th, 1881.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>,&mdash;I have again to ask the indulgence of the
House while I submit to it a few words in favor of my claim
to do that which the law requires me to do. Perhaps the
House will pardon me if I supply an omission, I feel unin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>tentionally
made, on the part of the hon. member for Chatham
in some words which have just fallen from him. I
understood him to say that he would use a formal statement
made by me to the Committee against what the Chancellor
of the Duchy had said I had said. I am sure the hon. and
learned member for Chatham, who has evidently read the
proceedings of the Committee with care, would, if he had
thought it fair, have stated to the House that the statement
only came from me after an objection made by me&mdash;a positive
objection on the ground that it related to matters outside
this House, and that the House in the course of its history
had never inquired into such matters; but I can hardly
understand what the member for Chatham meant when he
said that he contrasted what I did say with what the Chancellor
of the Duchy said I said, for it is not a matter of
memory, it is on the proceedings of this House, that being
examined formally before the Committee, I stated: &#8220;That
the essential part of the oath is in the fullest and most complete
degree binding upon my honor and conscience, and
that the repeating of the words of asseveration does not in
the slightest degree weaken the binding of the allegiance on
me.&#8221; I say now I would not go through any form&mdash;much
as I value the right to sit in this House, much as I desire
and believe that this House will accord me that right&mdash;that
I did not mean to be binding upon me without mental reservation,
without equivocation. I would go through no form
unless it were fully and completely and thoroughly binding
upon me as to what it expressed or promised. Mine has
been no easy position for the last twelve months. I have
been elected by the free votes of a free constituency. My
return is untainted. There is no charge of bribery (cheers),
no charge of corruption, nor of inducing men to come
drunken to the polling booth. I come here with a pure untainted
return&mdash;not won by accident. For thirteen long
years have I fought for this right&mdash;through five contested
elections, including this. It is now proposed to prevent me
from fulfilling the duty my constituents have placed upon
me. You have force&mdash;on my side is the law. The hon. and
learned member for Plymouth spoke the truth when he said
he did not ask the House to treat the matter as a question
of law, but the constituencies ask me to treat it as a question
of law. I, for them, ask you to treat it as a question of law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
I could understand the feeling that seems to have been
manifested were I some great and powerful personage. I
could understand it had I a huge influence behind me. I
am only one of the people, and you propose to teach them
that on a mere technical question you will put a barrier in
the way of my doing my duty which you have never
put in the way of anyone else. The question is, has
my return on the 9th of April, 1881, anything whatever
to impeach it? There is no legal disqualification
involved. If there were it could be raised by petition. The
hon. member for Plymouth says the dignity of this House
is in question. Do you mean that I can injure the dignity
of this House? This House which has stood unrivalled for
centuries? This House supreme among the assemblies of
the world? This House, which represents the traditions of
liberty? I should not have so libelled you. How is the
dignity of this House to be hurt? If what happened before
the 9th of April is less than a legal disqualification, it is a
matter for the judgment of the constituency and not for
you. The constituency has judged me; it has elected me.
I stand here with no legal disqualification upon me. The
right of the constituency to return me is an unimpeachable
right. I know some gentlemen make light of constituencies;
yet without the constituencies you are nothing. It is
from them you derive your whole and sole authority. The
hon. and learned member for Plymouth treats lightly the
legal question. It is dangerous to make light of the law&mdash;dangerous
because if you are only going to rely on your
strength of force to override the law, you give a bad lesson
to men whose morality you impeach as to what should be
their duty if emergence ever came (hear, hear). Always
outside the House I have advocated strenuous obedience to
the law, and it is under that law that I claim my right. It
is said by the right hon. baronet who interposes between me
and my duty that this House has passed some resolution.
First, I submit that that resolution does not affect the
return of the 9th April. The conditions are entirely different,
there is nothing since the date of that return. I
submit next that if it did affect it the resolution was illegal
from the beginning. In the words of George Grenville,
spoken in this House in 1769, I say if your resolution goes
in the teeth of the law&mdash;if against the statute&mdash;your reso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>lution
is null and void. No word have I uttered outside
these walls which has been lacking in respect to the House.
I believe the House will do me justice, and I ask it to look
at what it is I claim. I claim to do that which the law
says I must. Frankly, I would rather have affirmed.
When I came to the table of the House I deemed that I
had a legal right to do it. The courts have decided
against me, and I am bound by their decision. I have
the legal right to do what I propose to do. No resolution
of yours can take away that legal right. You may act
illegally and hinder me, and unfortunately I have no appeal
against you. &#8220;Unfortunately&#8221; perhaps I should not say.
Perhaps it is better that the Chamber which makes the
law should never be in conflict with the courts which administer
the laws that the Chamber makes. I think the word
&#8220;unfortunately&#8221; was not the word I ought to have used
in this argument. But the force that you invoke against
the law to-day may to-morrow be used against you, and
the use will be justified by your example. It is a fact
that I have no remedy if you rely on your force. I can
only be driven into a contest, wearying even to a strong
man well supported, ruinous and killing to one man standing
by himself&mdash;a contest in which if I succeed it will be
injurious to you as well as to me. Injurious to me because
I can only win by lessening your repute which I desire to
maintain. The only court I have the power of appealing
to is the court of public opinion, which I have no doubt
in the end will do me justice. The hon. member for Plymouth
said I had the manliness on a former occasion to
make an avowal of opinions to this House. I did nothing
of the kind. I have never, directly or indirectly, said one
word about my opinions, and this House has no right to
inquire what opinions I may hold outside its walls, the only
right is that which the statute gives you; my opinions there
is no right to inquire into. I shelter myself under the
laws of my country. This is a political assembly, met to
decide on the policy of the nation, and not on the religious
opinions of the citizens (cheers). While I had the honor of
occupying a seat in the House when questions were raised
which touched upon religious matters, I abstained from
uttering one word. I did not desire to say one word which
might hurt the feelings of even the most tender (hear).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
But it is said, why not have taken the oath quietly? I did
not take it then because I thought I had the right to do
something else, and I have paid the penalty. I have been
plunged in litigation fostered by men who had not the
courage to put themselves forward (loud cheers below the
gangway). I, a penniless man, should have been ruined if
it had not been that the men in workshop, pit, and factory
had enabled me to fight this battle (interruption). I am
sorry that hon. members cannot have patience with one
pleading as I plead here. It is no light stake, even if you
put it on the lowest personal grounds, to risk the ambition
of a life on such an issue. It is a right ambition to desire
to take part in the councils of the nation, if you bring no
store of wisdom with you, and can only learn from the great
intellects that we have (hear, hear). What will you inquire
into? The right hon. baronet would inquire into my
opinions. Will you inquire into my conduct, or is it only
my opinions you will try here? The hon. member for
Plymouth frankly puts it opinions. If opinions, why not
conduct? Why not examine into members&#8217; conduct when
they come to the table, and see if there be no members in
whose way you can put a barrier? (Hear, hear.) Are
members, whose conduct may be obnoxious, to vote my
exclusion because to them my opinions are obnoxious? As
to any obnoxious views supposed to be held by me, there is
no duty imposed upon me to say a word. The right hon.
baronet has said there has been no word of recantation.
You have no right to ask me for any recantation. Since
the 9th April you have no right to ask me for anything. If
you have a legal disqualification, petition, lay it before
the Judges. When you ask me to make a statement, you
are guilty of impertinence to me, of treason to the traditions
of this House, and of impeachment of the liberties of the
people. My difficulty is that those who have made the
most bitter attacks upon me only made them when I was
not here to deal with them. One hon. and gallant member
recently told his constituents that this would be made a
party question, but that the Conservative members had not
the courage to speak out against me. I should have thought,
from reading &#8220;Hansard,&#8221; not that they wanted courage, but
that they had cultivated a reticence that was more just. I
wish to say a word or two on the attempt which has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
made to put on the Government of the day complicity in my
views. The Liberal party has never aided me in any way
to this House. (Oh, from the Opposition.) Never. I have
fought by myself. I have fought by my own hand. I have
been hindered in every way that it was possible to
hinder me, and it is only by the help of the people, by the
pence of toilers in mine and factory, that I am here
to-day, after these five struggles right through thirteen
years. I have won my way with them, for I have won
their hearts, and now I come to you. Will you send me
back from here? Then how? You have the right, but it
is the right of force, and not of law. When I am once
seated on these benches, then I am under your jurisdiction.
At present I am under the protection of the writ from those
who sent me here. I do not want to quote what has
happened before, but if there be one lesson which the
House has recorded more solemnly than another, it is that
there should be no interference with the judgment of a
constituency in sending a man to this House against whom
there is no statutory disqualification. Let me appeal to the
generosity of the House as well as to its strength. It has
traditions of liberty on both sides. I do not complain that
members on that (the Conservative) side try to keep me out.
They act according to their lights, and think my poor services
may be injurious to them. (Cries of No.) Then why
not let me in? (Cheers.) It must be either a political or a
religious question. I must apologise to the House for
trespassing upon its patience. I apologise because I know
how generous in its listening it has been from the time of
my first speech in it till now. But I ask you now, do not
plunge with me into a struggle I would shun. The law
gives me no remedy if the House decides against me. Do
not mock at the constituencies. If you place yourselves
above the law, you leave me no course save lawless agitation
instead of reasonable pleading. It is easy to begin such a
strife, but none knows how it would end. I have no court,
no tribunal to appeal to; you have the strength of
your votes at the moment. You think I am an obnoxious
man, and that I have no one on my side. If that be so,
then the more reason that this House, grand in the strength
of its centuries of liberty, should have now that generosity
in dealing with one who to-morrow may be forced into a
struggle for public opinion against it (cheers).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s</span> Third Speech at the Bar of the House
of Commons, delivered February 7th, 1882.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In addressing the House for the third time from
this position, I feel the exceeding difficulty of dealing fairly
with myself without dealing unfairly with the House. If I
were to follow the hon. member who has just sat down into
his errors of law, of history, and of memory, into his reckless
misconceptions as to what are the views I hold and
write about, I should only be giving pain to numbers of
members here, and departing from that mandate with which
my constituents have trusted me. It is&mdash;I say it with
all respect&mdash;not true that I done anything more with reference
to the succession than maintain the right of Parliament,
meaning by Parliament both Houses, to control it;
and any member who pretends that I done anything else,
either does it, not having read what I have written, or
heard what I have said, or having forgotten entirely what
I have written or said, and being extremely careless in
representing my views to the House. I regret that the
hon. member should have imported into the discussion some
fact supposed to have occurred in a police-court since I
stood here before. I can only give the House my positive
assurance that the hon. member is perfectly inaccurate in
his representation of what took place. It is exceedingly
painful to bandy words in this way. The hon. member was
good enough to say he did not hear&mdash;he could not well have
heard, for the magistrate did not refuse my affirmation at
all. I happened to have been before Sir J. Ingham before,
and he knew me, and knew the particular form of affirmation,
and when the clerk read it to me no discussion took
place on the subject. I hope the House will forgive me for
contradicting such a small thing, but small things are
sometimes much used. They have been used to work my
ruin since I stood here before, and I regret that the shame
of reticence did not at least keep it from this House, that
the hon. member thought it his duty, by a common informer,
to attempt to drive me into the Bankruptcy Court, and outside
this House has boasted that the question would be
solved in that way. It may be a brave boast, it may be
consonant with piety from the hon. member&#8217;s point of view,
but I believe that every other gentleman&#8217;s sense of piety
would revolt against the notion of driving a single man into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
bankruptcy, and then canvassing for subscriptions&mdash;(hear,
hear)&mdash;for the &#8220;bold and vigorous, and patriotic
and noble conduct,&#8221; as the advertisement said, which
consisted in hurrying in a cab to find the common
informer to issue a writ against me. I dismiss that, however.
I ask the House to pardon me for having wasted
its time on this poor thing. I do not hope, I dare not
think, that any word I may say here will win one vote;
and I would have let this go silently against me, were
it not that I owe a duty to the constituency that has
twice entrusted me with its suffrages, a duty to every constituency
right through the land in time to come&mdash;(hear, hear)&mdash;whose
representative may be challenged as Northampton&#8217;s
has been. (Hear, hear, and No.) Some gentlemen say
&#8220;No,&#8221; but where is the challenge to stop? (Hear.) It
is not simply theology, it is politics too (hear, hear). It
is not simply theology that is brought before the House, but
the wild imaginings of some member who, with the nightmare
of panic upon him, and a wild imagining of the French
Revolution clothed in terrors of which I know nothing,
comes here to tell you of mighty Russia successful, and of
the unfortunate United States with its Presidents assassinated
because of religious and political opinions. Panic of
that kind is not evidence as to my opinions. If this House
intends to try me for my opinions, let it do it reasonably,
and at least have the evidence before it. I would show you
how unfair it is to trust to memory of words. The hon.
member was good enough to tell the House that I had
declared to a Committee of the House that certain words
were meaningless. I hold in my hand the report of the
Committee and the minutes of evidence, and no such words
exist in any declaration of mine. (Hear, hear. Mr. Newdegate
shook his head.) The hon. member does not believe
me. I cannot make more than facts. I cannot make the
comprehension which should distinguish when prejudice has
determined that nothing shall be right that is put. The
only way in which it can be pretended that anything of the
kind in reference to the oath can be brought in is by taking
my letter of the 20th of May, written outside the House,
which does not contain a specific declaration the hon.
member has put into it, which letter I protested ought not
to be brought before the Committee at all, which I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
volunteered to the Committee&mdash;(Opposition laughter)&mdash;which
I objected to the Committee having before them.
(Oh, and laughter from the Opposition.) The gentlemen
who laugh, laugh because the laugh is the only answer that
could be given. No reason can be given in reply, no facts
can be quoted; and I ask hon. members who laugh to remember
that I am pleading as though a quasi-criminal at
this bar, and that I have a right to an audience from them,
and I appeal to the House at least to give me a silent
hearing. Judges do that. If you are unfit to be judges,
then do not judge (hear, hear). It shows, at least, the
difficulty of dealing with a question like this, when those
who are to judge have come to a judgment already, not upon
any facts, but upon what they think ought to be the facts.
I ask the House to deal legally and fairly with me. Legally
you are bound to deal; fairly, as an assembly of English gentlemen,
you ought to deal with me, even if you have differences
with me, even if you think my opinions so obnoxious, even
if you think that the politics with which you identify me in
your minds are dangerous to you (oh, oh). If I am not
dangerous, why not let me speak there? (pointing to the seat
he occupied last Session.) If there is no danger, why
strain the law? If there is no danger, why disobey the
law? It is put by the hon. gentleman who spoke last that
there are certain words of the oath which the courts of law
have declared essential, The courts of law have declared
the exact opposite. So far as a decision has been given,
the very report of the Committee shows that the highest
court of judicature in this realm has decided the words are
not essential to the oath at all. I ask the House to deal
with me with some semblance and show of legality and
fairness, and first I say that they ought not to go behind
my election of the 9th of April, 1881, and that the House
ought to reject the resolution moved by the right hon.
gentleman, because it deals with matters which antedate my
election, and because the House has nothing to do with me
before the 9th of April, 1881. That is the return of which
the Clerk at the table has the certificate. That is my only
authority for being here. If I did aught before that
rendered me unworthy to sit here, why did the House let
me sit here from the 2nd of July to the 29th of March?
If what I did entitles the House not to receive me, why has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
not the House had the courage of its opinions and vacated
the seat? Either the seat is mine in law, and in law I
claim it from you, or I am unworthy to hold it, and then
why not vacate the seat and let the constituency express its
opinion again? But my return is unimpeached, it is unimpeachable,
and there has been no petition against me. The
hon. member who went into back alleys for common
informers could not find a petitioner to present a petition
against it. If I speak with temper&mdash;(Opposition laughter)&mdash;the
House, I trust, will pardon me. I have read within
the last few days words spoken, not by members of no consequence,
but by members occupying high position in this
House, which make me wonder if this is the House of Commons
to which I aspired so much. I have read that one
right hon. member, the member for Whitehaven&mdash;(laughter
from the Ministerial side)&mdash;was prompted to say to his constituents
that I was kicked down stairs last Session, and that
he hoped I should be again. If it were true that I was kicked
downstairs I would ask members of the House of Commons
on whom the shame, on whom the disgrace, on whom the
stigma? I dare not apply this, but history will when I
have mouldered, and you too, and our passions are quite
gone. But it is not quite true that I was kicked downstairs,
and it is a dangerous thing to say that I was, for it
means that hon. members who should rely on law rely on
force. It is a dangerous provocation to conflict to throw to
the people. If I had been as wicked in my thought as some
members are reported to have been in their speech, this
quarrel, not of my provoking, would assume a future to
make us all ashamed. I beg this House to believe, and I
trust, Sir, that you at least will believe me, that I have tried
as much as man might to keep the dignity of this House. I
submitted last Session, and the Session before, to have had
things said against me without one word of reply, because
having had your good counsel, I felt it might provoke discussion
upon matters which this House would willingly not
have speech upon, and that I had far better rest under some
slight stigma than occupy the House with my personality.
I appeal to the recollection of every member of the House
whether from the moment of my entering into it I did not
utterly disregard everything that took place prior to my
coming into it, and direct myself to the business for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
my constituents sent me here. The most extraordinary
statements are made as to my views, statements as inaccurate
as those which have fallen, no doubt unconsciously,
from the hon. member who has last addressed the House.
One noble lord in a great London gathering convoked
against me, a gathering which was not as successful as some
that have taken place in my favor, denounced me as a
Socialist. I do not happen to be one. I happen to think
that Socialists are the most unwise and illogical people you
can happen to meet. But the noble lord knew that I ought
to be something (laughter). I am a red rag to a wild Conservative
bull, and it must rush at me and call me Socialist.
I ask this House to be more fair and just. If I am to be
tried, at least let me be tried for the opinions I hold and the
views I express. Why, there are members who have soiled
their tongues with words about social relations and marriage
for which I have no proper reply in this House, as unfortunately
the forms of the House do not permit me to use
the only fitting answer, and perhaps it is as well. But I ask
the House, Do not let this be the kind of weapon with which
a return is met. Deal with me as the law directs, and in
no other way. It is said &#8220;You have brought this upon
yourself&#8221; (hear, hear). One baronet who has spoken of
me with a kindness more than I deserve, in the very borough
which I represent said I had brought it upon myself, because
when I originally came to the House I flaunted and most
ostentatiously put my opinion upon the House (hear, hear).
Well, not one word of that is true. Not a shadow of it is
true. I hold in my hand the sworn evidence of Sir Erskine
May. I do not ask gentlemen to take my word, for it is
clear they will not, but that of their own officer. And when
the right hon. baronet said I claimed under the statute, and
drew an inference from it, he knows that my claim contained
no such words until the clerk at the table of
the House challenged me as to the law under which I
claimed. I do not quarrel with him, but I submit that the
Clerk of the House had no right to put that question to me.
I submit that the House had nothing whatever to do with
it&mdash;that it certainly is no ostentatious flaunting by me. I
submit, that at any rate, that it is prior to the 9th of April,
1881, and the House had no right to revive it against me.
I ask the House to try and deal with me with some show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of fairness. They will find when I was before the Committee,
instead of obtruding my opinions, I said I had
never directly or indirectly obtruded upon the House any
of my utterances or publications upon any subject whatever,
and when pressed by one of the members sitting on
that (the Opposition) side of the House as to certain
opinions I was supposed to hold, by asking me particular
words I was supposed to have used in a judicial proceeding,
I said that if the Committee wished I would answer, but
that I objected to answer, because I had carefully refrained
from saying any word which would bring my opinions
before the House. I ask, therefore, the House whether it
is not monstrously unfair to say that I have obtruded any
opinions here when I have expressly, carefully, and
thoroughly kept them from the House? But it is said by
the right hon. baronet that it would be a profanation to
allow me to take the oath, and that the House would be no
party to such a profanation (Opposition cheers). Does the
House mean that it is a party to each oath taken? (hear.)
There was a time when most clearly it was not so a party.
There was a time when the oath was not even taken in the
presence of members at all. But does the House mean it
is a party now? Was it a party the Session before last?
Was it a party when Mr. Hall walked up to that table,
cheered by members on the other side who knew his seat
was won by deliberate bribery? (loud Opposition cries of
Order.) Bribery sought to be concealed by the most corrupt
perjury. Did the House join in it? (renewed cries of
Order.) If the House did not join in it, why did you cheer
so that the words of the oath were drowned? But was the
House a party when John Stuart Mill sat in this House?
(hear, no.) A member who is, I think, now within the
walls of the House&mdash;the hon. member for Greenwich&mdash;in
addressing his constituents, said that Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s
opinions were hardly more objectionable than those of some
other members of the House. If the hon. member knew
that, then he was a party to the profanation of the oath:
but perhaps they were on his own side, and he did not feel
the profanation so acutely (hear, hear, and laughter).
But it is said, &#8220;Our real objection is that you have declared
that the oath is not binding upon you&#8221; (hear, hear, from
Mr. Alderman Fowler). That is exactly the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of what I did declare. The hon. member whose voice
I hear now, I unfortunately heard on the 3rd of August;
and heard so that I shall never forget it. (Mr. Bradlaugh
here looked towards Alderman Fowler and paused.)
The hon. member admits that is the point&mdash;that I
have declared the oath is not binding upon my conscience;
but, unfortunately, all the print goes the other way. I am
asked by the Committee who sat as to whether the oath is
binding, and on page 15 I reply: &#8220;Any form that I went
through, any oath that I took, I shall regard as binding
upon my conscience in the fullest degree, and I would go
through no form and take no oath unless I meant it to be
so binding.&#8221; Again, I am asked as to the word &#8220;swear.&#8221; I
say: &#8220;I consider when I take an oath it is binding upon
my honor and upon my conscience&#8221;; and with reference
to the words of asseveration to which the hon. member for
North Warwickshire referred, he would at least have been
more generous towards myself, if generosity be possible
with him, if he had said: &#8220;I desire to add&mdash;and I do this
most solemnly and unreservedly&mdash;that the taking, and subscribing,
and repeating these words of asseveration will in
no degree weaken the binding effect of the oath upon my
conscience.&#8221; I say here, Sir, before you, with all the
solemnity man can command, that I know the words of the
oath the statute requires me to take, that I am ready to
take that oath according to law, and that I will not take an
oath without intending it to be binding upon me, and that
if I do take the oath it will be binding upon my honor and
conscience. (Conservative cries of &#8220;Oh! oh!&#8221;) Members
of the House who are ignorant of what is honor and conscience&mdash;&mdash;(Loud
cries of &#8220;Order,&#8221; &#8220;Oh, oh,&#8221; and &#8220;Withdraw,&#8221;
from the Opposition.) If members will allow me
to finish my sentence&mdash;&mdash;(Cries of &#8220;Withdraw.&#8221;) Members
of this House who are ignorant of what is&mdash;&mdash;(Renewed
cries from the Opposition of &#8220;Withdraw.&#8221;) These (Mr.
Bradlaugh pointing to the Opposition benches) are my judges.
Members of this House who are ignorant of what is the honor
and conscience of the man who stands before them&mdash;(&#8220;Oh,&#8221;
and laughter from the Opposition)&mdash;have a right to shout
&#8220;Withdraw;&#8221; but they must beware lest a greater voice
outside&mdash;(&#8220;Oh, oh,&#8221; and laughter from the Opposition)&mdash;at
the ballot-box, where it has a right to express it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
may not only say &#8220;withdraw,&#8221; but make withdraw all those
who infringe the constitutional rights of the nation, as they
seek to infringe them now. If I knew any kind of word
which might convince members whom I desire to convince
that I would take no pledge that I did not mean to be
binding, I would use that form of words. But I have found
myself so harshly judged, so unfairly dealt with, that
one feels a difficulty in understanding whether any form
of words, however often repeated, would convey any
kind of conviction to some minds. I presume that this
House will repeat its vote of April 26th. What then?
Will it have the courage of its opinions, and vacate my
seat? (Hear, hear.) If it does not, this House leaves me in
an unfair position before the law. I am bound to come
to this table, and will come to this table, as long as the
mandate of my constituents sends me here, unless the House
vacates the seat. If my seat be vacated, it is my duty to
bow to the House, and appeal to my constituents again;
and then the verdict rests with them. But to take away
part of the right, and deal with it in this fashion, leaving
me with the full legal responsibility and no kind of legal
authority, I submit is not generous. Well, will this House
repeat its vote of 9th May? Will it substitute force for
law? At present the law is on my side (No, no, and hear,
hear). If not, let me sit and sue me (hear, hear). If not,
try by petition. If not, bring an action. But shouting
&#8220;No&#8221; won&#8217;t decide the law, even with the united wisdom
of the members of this House who shout it. I know that
no man is a good advocate for a great principle unless he
himself be worthy of the principle he advocates, and I have
felt acutely the judgment properly passed upon me by many
members of this House, who, knowing their superiority to me,
say how unworthy I am that this question should be fought
in my person. I admit I am unworthy, but it is not my
fault that I have this fight to make. I remind you of the
words of one of the greatest statesmen who sat in this
House more than a hundred years ago, that whenever an
infringement of the constitutional right was attempted, it
was always attempted in the person of some obnoxious man
(hear, hear). I ask the House for a moment to carry its
mind to the 3rd of August last. I do that because either
I do not understand what took place then, or my memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
has failed me, as the memory of other hon. members sometimes
does, or things happened without my consciousness. I
thought I had stood aside until Parliament had dealt with
the pressing business of the nation. I thought that had
been recognised by this House. I thought I only came
saying at the very door of the House that I was ready to
obey its lawful orders, and I thought I was then seized by
force while saying it. My memory may not serve me well
on that, but I think it does. There were plenty of witnesses
to the scene. I saw one hon. member climb on to a pedestal
to see how fourteen men could struggle with one. It was
hardly generous, hardly brave, hardly worthy of the great
House of Commons, that those sending out to the whole
world lessons of freedom, liberty, and law, should so infringe
and so stamp them under foot. I had no remedy in any
court, or I would have taken it. With all respect to you,
Sir, and the officers of this House, if there had been any
possibility of trying at law against the mighty privilege of
this House, I would have appealed to that possibility. Let
me now, before I finish, ask the ear of the House for one
moment. It is said it is the oath and not the man; but
others, more frank, say it is the man and not the oath.
Is it the oath and not the man? I am ready to stand
aside, say for four or five weeks, without coming to
that table, if the House within that time, or within
such time as its great needs might demand, would discuss
whether an Affirmation Bill should pass or not. I want to
obey the law, and I tell you how I might meet the House
still further, if the House will pardon me for seeming to
advise it. Hon. members have said that would be a Bradlaugh
Relief Bill (hear, hear). Bradlaugh is more proud
than you are (hear, hear). Let the Bill pass without applying
to elections that have taken place previously, and I
will undertake not to claim my seat, and when the Bill has
passed I will apply for the Chiltern Hundreds (cheers.) I
have no fear. If I am not fit for my constituents, they
shall dismiss me, but you never shall. The grave alone
shall make me yield (hear, hear, and &#8220;Oh&#8221;).</p>

<p class="center">HENRY EDWARD,</p>

<p class="center">CARDINAL-ARCHBISHOP OF WESTMINSTER.</p>

<p>Three times your Eminence has&mdash;through the pages of the
<i>Nineteenth Century</i>&mdash;personally and publicly interfered and
used the weight of your ecclesiastical position against me
in the Parliamentary struggle in which I am engaged,
although you are neither voter in the borough for which I
am returned to sit, nor even co-citizen in the state to which
I belong. Your personal position is that of a law-breaker,
one who has deserted his sworn allegiance and
thus forfeited his citizenship, one who is tolerated by
English forbearance, but is liable to indictment for misdemeanor
as &#8220;member of a society of the Church of
Rome.&#8221; More than once, when the question of my
admission to the House of Commons has been under
discussion in that House, have I seen you busy in the
lobby closely attended by the devout and sober Philip
Callan, or some other equally appropriate Parliamentary
henchman. Misrepresenting what had taken place in the
House of Commons when I took my seat on affirmation in
July, 1880, your Eminence wrote in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>
for August, 1880, that which you were pleased to entitule
&#8220;An Englishman&#8217;s Protest&#8221; against my being allowed to
sit in the Commons&#8217; House, to which the vote of a free constituency
had duly returned me. In that protest you
blundered alike in your law and in your history. You gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_4" id="Page_2_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the Tudor Parliamentary oath Saxon and Norman antiquity.
You spoke of John Horne Tooke as having had the door
of the House shut against him by a by-vote, no such by-vote
having been carried, and the statute which disabled clergymen
in the future not affecting John Horne Tooke&#8217;s seat
in that Parliament. You declared that in the French
Revolution the French voted out the Supreme Being; there
is no record of any such vote. In March, 1882, when the
House had expelled me for my disobedience of its orders in
complying with the law, and taking my seat, you again
used the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>. This time for a second protest,
intended to prevent my re-election. You, in both your
articles, reminded the bigots that I might be indicted for
blasphemy. Your advice has since been followed. Persecution
is a &#8220;two-edged sword,&#8221; and I return the warning
you offer to Lord Sherbrooke. When I was in Paris some
time since, and was challenged to express an opinion as to the
enforcement of the law against the religious orders in France,
I, not to the pleasure of many of my friends, spoke out very
freely that in matters of religion I would use the law against
none; but your persecuting spirit may provoke intemperate
men even farther than you dream. In this country, by the
10th George IV., cap. 7, secs. 28 and 29, 31, 32 and 34,
you are criminally indictable, Cardinal-Archbishop of
Westminster. You only reside here without police challenge
by the merciful forbearance of the community. And
yet you parade in political contest your illegal position as &#8220;a
member of a religious order of the Church of Rome,&#8221; and
have the audacity to invoke outlawry and legal penalty
against me. Last month, in solemn state, you, in defiance
of the law, in a personal and official visit to the borough of
Northampton itself, sought to weaken the confidence of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_5" id="Page_2_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
constituents; and you were not ashamed, in order to injure
me, to pretend friendship with men who have for years
constantly and repeatedly used the strongest and foulest
abuse of your present Church. An amiable but ignorant
Conservative mayor, chief magistrate of the borough, but
innocent of statutes, was misled into parading his official
robe and office while you openly broke the law in his
presence. In the current number of the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>
you fire your last shot, and are coarse in Latin as well as
in the vulgar tongue. Perhaps the frequenting Philip Callan
has spoiled your manners. It else seems impossible that one
who was once a cultured scholar and a refined gentleman
could confuse with legitimate argument the abuse of his
opponents as &#8220;cattle.&#8221; But who are you, Henry Edward
Manning, that you should throw stones at me, and should so
parade your desire to protect the House of Commons from
contamination? At least, first take out of it the drunkard
and the dissolute of your own Church. You know them well
enough. Is it the oath alone which stirs you? Your tenderness
on swearing comes very late in life. When you took
orders as a deacon of the English Church, in presence
of your bishop, you swore &#8220;so help me, God,&#8221; that
you did from your &#8220;heart abhor, detest and abjure,&#8221; and,
with your hand on the &#8220;holy gospels,&#8221; you declared &#8220;that
no foreign prince, person, prelate, state, or potentate hath,
or ought to have, any jurisdiction, power, superiority, pre-eminence,
or authority, ecclesiastical or spiritual, within
this realm.&#8221; You may now well write of men &#8220;whom no oath
can bind.&#8221; The oath you took you have broken; and yet
it was because you had, in the very church itself, taken
this oath, that you for many years held more than one
profitable preferment in the Established Church of England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_6" id="Page_2_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
You indulge in inuendoes against my character in order to
do me mischief, and viciously insinuate as though my life
had in it justification for good men&#8217;s abhorrence. In this
you are very cowardly as well as very false. Then, to
move the timid, you suggest &#8220;the fear of eternal punishment,&#8221;
as associated with a broken oath. Have you any
such fear? or have you been personally conveniently absolved
from the &#8220;eternal&#8221; consequences of your perjury?
Have you since sworn another oath before another bishop
of another church, or made some solemn vow to Rome, in
lieu of, and in contradiction to, the one you so took in
presence of your bishop, when, &#8220;in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost,&#8221; that bishop of the church by law
established in this country accepted your oath, and gave you
authority as a deacon in the Church you have since forsaken.
I do not blame you so much that you are forsworn: there
are, as you truly say, &#8220;some men whom no oath can bind;&#8221;
and it has often been the habit of the cardinals of your
Church to take an oath and break it when profit came with
breach; but your remembrance of your own perjury might
at least keep you reticent in very shame. Instead of this,
you thrust yourself impudently into a purely political contest,
and shout as if the oath were to you the most sacred
institution possible. You say &#8220;there are happily some men
who believe in God and fear him.&#8221; Do you do either?
You, who declared, &#8220;So help me, God&#8221; that no foreign
&#8220;prelate ... ought to have any jurisdiction or authority
ecclesiastical or spiritual within this realm.&#8221; And you&mdash;who
in spite of your declaration on oath have courted
and won, intrigued for and obtained, the archbishop&#8217;s
authority and the cardinal&#8217;s hat from the Pope of
Rome&mdash;you rebuke Lord Sherbrooke for using the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_7" id="Page_2_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
words &#8220;sin and shame&#8221; in connexion with oath-taking;
do you hold now that there was no sin and no shame in
your broken oath? None either in the rash taking
or the wilful breaking? Have you no personal shame
that you have broken your oath? Or do the pride
and pomp of your ecclesiastical position outbribe your
conscience? You talk of the people understanding
the words &#8220;so help me, God.&#8221; How do you understand
them of your broken oath? Do they mean to you:
&#8220;May God desert and forsake me as I deserted and forsook
the Queen&#8217;s supremacy, to which I so solemnly swore allegiance&#8221;?
You speak of men being kept to their allegiance
by the oath &#8220;which binds them to their sovereign.&#8221; You
say such men may be tempted by ambition or covetousness
unless they are bound by &#8220;the higher and more sacred
responsibility&#8221; involved in the &#8220;recognition of the lawgiver
in the oath.&#8221; Was the Rector of Lavington and
Graffham covetous of an archbishopric that he broke his
oath? Was the Archdeacon of Chichester ambitious of
the Cardinal&#8217;s hat that he became so readily forsworn?
Lord Archbishop of Westminster, had you, when you were
apostate, remained a poor and simple priest in poverty and
self-denial, although your oath would have still been broken,
yet you might have taunted others more profited by their
perjuries. But you, who have derived profit, pride, and
pomp from your false swearing&mdash;you, who sign yourself
&#8220;Henry Edward, Cardinal-Archbishop&#8221; by favor of the very
authority you abjured in the name of God&mdash;it is in the
highest degree indecent and indecorous for you to parade yourself
as a defender of the sanctity of the oath. As a prince-prelate
of the Church of Rome you have no right to meddle
with the question of the English Parliamentary oath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_8" id="Page_2_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Your Church has been the foe of liberty through the
world, and I am honored by your personal assailment. But
you presume too much on the indifference of the age when,
in this free England, you so recklessly exhibit as weapons
in an election contest the outward signs of the authority the
Vatican claims, but shall never again exercise, in Britain.</p>

<p class="hangindent">To the Right Hon. <span class="smcap">Sir Stafford H. Northcote</span>, M.P.,
G.C.B.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;If, on either of the occasions when recently moving
against me in the House of Commons, you had accorded
or claimed for me opportunity of speech in self-defence, I
might have been spared the need for this letter.</p>

<p>Apparently your view is that a member unfortunate
enough to have the majority of the House against him
need not have even the semblance of fairness shown him&mdash;that
you, being strong, need not be troubled with scruples,
and that the mere fact that the member is, like yourself,
the chosen member of a constituency does not entitle him
to the smallest courtesy or consideration.</p>

<p>You have taught me, Sir, many lessons during the past
four years. Some of these I trust to remember and profit
by in the future. You have taught me that a temporary
majority of the House may, year after year, exclude any
member of Parliament from his seat, although he has
strictly obeyed every Standing Order&mdash;and this without
vacating that seat&mdash;that it may so exclude the member
although he has been a decent and orderly member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_4" id="Page_3_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
House, attending regularly for months to all its duties,
and one against whom no charge or pretence of Parliamentary
misconduct was made whilst he so served in it.</p>

<p>You have taught me, Sir, that the leader of a great party
may sit silent, and acquiesce in it by his support, while
the law-abiding electors of a great constituency are called
&#8220;mob,&#8221; &#8220;dregs,&#8221; and &#8220;scum&#8221;&mdash;that such a leader may
permit his followers to openly accuse two of the highest
judges of our country of having judicially decided unfairly
from corrupt party motives&mdash;that he may even, without
dishonor, keep silence whilst it is suggested that the whole
judicial bench is so corrupt that it will be ready to decide
unjustly at the bidding of a government&mdash;and that the
first law officer of the Crown is ready to be fraudulently
collusive with myself. Did you believe these things, Sir,
when they were stated and loudly cheered by those who
sit around you on your side of the House? If yes, I am
glad that your experience of humanity has been less fortunate
than my own. I have regarded our judges as at least
striving to be just and independent. You seem to think
it nothing that the highest judges should, in your presence,
be charged with judging unjustly from favoritism for the
government of the day.</p>

<p>You have encouraged and practised deliberate violation
of the law, and, to cover this law-breaking, you have connived
at, and been party to, the basest insinuations against
those whose duty it is to judicially pronounce on matters
of legal dispute. You have, without rebuke, permitted
your followers to declare that if the High Court of Judicature
declared the law to be in my favor, that then they
and you still intended to defy and disobey the law.</p>

<p>The first resolution you moved against me, on the 11th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_5" id="Page_3_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
February, was worse than futile, for it forbade me to do
that which I had already done, and which you well knew
that I had so done, in order to compel the submission to
the judgment of a competent tribunal of the legality of
my act.</p>

<p>The ridiculous form of your resolution arose because
you&mdash;having bargained with me in writing through Mr.
Winn that I should come to the table immediately after
questions, and not before&mdash;intended to interpose ere I
could reach the table. This would have been a dishonest
trick had you succeeded; it became contemptibly ridiculous
when you failed; but it is a lesson to me that I must
be careful, indeed, when English gentlemen of name and
family make treaties with me.</p>

<p>Your second resolution, on February 11th, was a spiteful,
paltry, and cowardly insult to myself and to my constituents,
for it was pressed by you despite that my
colleague offered for me the express undertaking that you
pretended you wished to secure, and was still pressed by
you though Mr. Burt offered for me that I would at once
personally give such undertaking. These two resolutions,
utterly illegal and dangerous to Parliamentary repute, you
have renewed on Thursday, the 21st, although you had
heard read by Mr. Speaker an undertaking from me to
the House that I would not attempt to take my seat until
the judicial interpreters of the law had given formal
judgment. And they are very cowardly and inexcusable
resolutions, spiteful in excess of any ever passed in previous
years. They exclude me, not only from the House, but
from the reading-room, library, tea-room, dining-rooms,
and exterior lobbies, though there is not the faintest
suggestion that I have used my right to go to those places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_6" id="Page_3_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
to enable me to disturb the House. If I had not taken
the precaution to anticipate your malice, I should actually
have been hindered by force from going to the proper
officer to obtain the certificate of my return. Yours is a
mean and spiteful act, Sir, unworthy an English gentleman.
And I admit that you have inconvenienced me, for
you have deprived me of access to the library of the House,
and you may thus put me to some expense and annoyance
in the procurement of law books and Parliamentary records
in the litigation in which I am involved in defending the
rights of my constituents.</p>

<p>It is too much that, in 1884, a duly-elected and properly-qualified
burgess of Parliament should be shut outside by
such votes.</p>

<p>To repeat to you words signed, in September, 1656, by
your own ancestor, Sir John Northcote, M.P. for the
County of Devon: &#8220;we who have been duly chosen to be
members of the Parliament, have an undoubted right to
meet, sit, and vote in Parliament,&#8221; and &#8220;no part of the
representative body are trusted to consent to anything in
the nation&#8217;s behalf if the whole have not their free liberty
of debating and voting in the matters propounded.&#8221; To
continue the language of your sturdy ancestor, you have
&#8220;now declared that the people&#8217;s choice cannot give a man
a right to sit in Parliament, but the right must be derived
from <i>your</i> gracious will and pleasure.&#8221; You reply that
you have the force on your side; but Sir John Northcote
declared that: &#8220;The violent exclusion of any of the people&#8217;s
deputies from doing their duties and executing their trust
freely in Parliament doth change the state of the people
from freedom into a mere slavery;&#8221; and if you tell me
that the majority of the present members of the House are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_7" id="Page_3_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
with you in what you do, I recall Sir John Northcote&#8217;s
protest: &#8220;That all such chosen members for Parliament
as shall take upon them to approve of the forcible exclusion
of other chosen members, or shall sit, vote, and act by the
name of the Parliament of England while, to their knowledge,
any of the chosen members are so by force shut
out, we say such ought to be reputed betrayers of the
liberties of England.&#8221;</p>

<p>You cannot now pretend with any hope that sane men
will believe you, that you desire &#8220;to prevent the profanation
of the oath.&#8221; In 1880 you prevented the second reading
of the Affirmation Bill, introduced by my colleague, Mr.
Labouchere, under the pretext that such a measure ought
to be introduced by the Government. In 1881, after you
yourself had said the matter should be dealt with by
legislation, you prevented the Government from introducing
it. In 1882 your friends blocked the Affirmation
measure again proposed by my colleague, and in 1883 you
exerted every influence to defeat, and successfully defeated,
the Affirmation Bill brought forward by the Government.</p>

<p>If you had really believed the oath profaned by me, you
would have been one of the first to aid in removing the
possible profanation by substituting the right of affirmation.
In Ulster you took credit for keeping an Atheist
out of Parliament, but it was not my Atheism you kept
out, for I actually sat with you day by day, speaking,
voting, and serving, from the beginning of July, 1880,
until the end of March, 1881. And, during the whole of
that time, my care was to be at least as good and loyal a
member of that House as any sitting within its walls. I
do not plead my conduct there, whilst using all my right,
as anything on my behalf, for I at most could do no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_8" id="Page_3_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
than my duty; but at least I have the right to say that
it was never suggested that I was other than a good
working member of the House, strict in my attendance at
and during every one of its sittings. It cannot be pretended
that I used my right of speech to force upon the
House one word which did not relate to the business then
being dealt with, or that in any fashion I obtruded upon
what should be a purely political assembly any views of
mine on matters of religion.</p>

<p>You have permitted in public my conduct to be misstated
in your presence, and utterances in Parliament to
be attributed to me which are none of mine, and you have
done this because you hoped that, by exciting religious and
social prejudice against me, you might weaken the Government,
and crawl back into office. To injure the Liberal
party, you have allowed words which you pretend are
sacred to be used as party cries, and you have made
hundreds of thousands examine into and declare in favor
of my opinions and expressions on religious questions who
but for you might perhaps have never even known my
name. You have allied yourself at Westminster with men
whom you denounced in Ireland as &#8220;traitors and disloyal,&#8221;
in order that, with their help, you might insult an English
constituency; and you have succeeded in bringing Parliamentary
Government into contempt by parading the House
of Commons as the chief law-breaking assembly in the
world. In four years against me you have done your
worst to destroy me; with your own purse you have
helped the various projects to ruin me; and you have so
failed that clergymen and Nonconformist ministers have
been driven to support me from very indignation against
the injury you have done to the cause of religion. Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_9" id="Page_3_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Conservative associations have flooded the country with
leaflets containing garbled and misleading extracts from
my speeches and writings, and have thus excited the
curiosity of many whom I could have never reached.
These, procuring my works, and finding that my words
have been distorted and taken out of context, give a favor
to me that I should perhaps have never otherwise won.</p>

<p>Few believe that you are moved by religious motives.
Mr. Newdegate is regarded as sincere, though his sanity
is doubted; but when men recollect the past and even
present lives of many of those around you, whose tongues
so loudly declare their piety, they come, not unnaturally,
to the conclusion that he is the worst infidel who trails the
banner of his church in the mire of political warfare, and
permits the votes of the drunken, the dissolute, the dishonest,
and the disloyal to be canvassed by his whips so
that they may be counted on the side which he parades as
that of the pure and the holy.</p>

<p>On the 7th February, 1882, I told you and your
majority: &#8220;If I am not fit for my constituents, they shall
dismiss me, but you never shall.&#8221; I have gone since
voluntarily to my constituents&mdash;to those from whom you
presented a petition with 10,400 mock signatures upon it.
The answer has come at the ballot-box. My constituents
bid me resist you, and I will. They trust me to defeat
you, and I will. The law is on my side, and you fear its
pronouncement. You kept me from the possibility of
obtaining a decision as long as you could, but on the 11th
February I broke through your barriers. Then you fruitlessly
tried to erase all trace of my voting, and when you
found that I beat you on this by adding a new vote as you
rubbed out the vote before, then, in malicious spite, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_10" id="Page_3_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
shut me out of the tea-room, dining-room, cloak-room, and
library. For shame, Sir Stafford Northcote! This was
worthy of &#8220;O&#8217;Donnell,&#8221; but not of the leader of a great
party. You wear knightly orders. You should be above
a knave&#8217;s spitefulness.</p>

<p>My turn is coming. You have won sympathy for me
throughout the land; you have made Northampton men
stand by me closer than ever; you are now awaking the
country to stand by Northampton. Mr. Justice Stephen
says that the appeal is to the constituencies, and I appeal.
In the name of justice, by the hope of liberty, in memory
of English struggles for freedom, I appeal, and I hear the
answer growing as you shall hear it, too, on the day when,
from my place in the House, I move: &#8220;That all the resolutions
respecting Charles Bradlaugh, member for Northampton,
hindering him from obeying the law, and punishing
him for having obeyed the law, be expunged from the
Journals of this House as being subversive of the rights of
the whole body of electors of this kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p class="ralign"><i>March 4th, 1884.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;There are some points in the letter you have
addressed to me which I am unwilling to pass over in
silence lest I should be taken to admit your assertions.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is necessary that I should point out
to you that the action of the House of Commons with
respect to yourself has not been arbitrary or capricious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_11" id="Page_3_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
but has been founded on principles deliberately adopted
by a large majority of its members of various political
opinions, to which principles they have steadily adhered,
and which they have always been prepared to justify.</p>

<p>In the second place it should be clearly understood that in
all the steps which we have taken with respect to yourself,
including some which we took with the greatest reluctance,
we were acting on the defensive, in consequence of your
repeated attempts to override or to evade the repeated
decisions of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>The brief history of your case is this. You were duly
elected member for Northampton at the General Election
of 1880. On presenting yourself to take your seat you
tendered an affirmation instead of an oath, and supported
your claim to affirm by reference to the fact that you had
been permitted to do so in a court of law under the
Evidence Amendment Acts of 1869 and 1870. That claim
at once, and necessarily, brought under the notice of the
House that you must either yourself have objected in a
court of law to take an oath, or must have been objected
to as incompetent to do so, and that the presiding judge
must have been satisfied that the taking of an oath would
have no binding effect upon your conscience.</p>

<p>That being so, a Committee was appointed by the House
to consider whether the Evidence Amendment Acts were
applicable to the case of a member of the House of Commons
desiring to take his seat and to comply with the
necessary conditions.</p>

<p>It was held by the Committee that they were not so
applicable, and this finding of the Committee was subsequently
confirmed by the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>Upon being refused permission to affirm, you immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_12" id="Page_3_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
came to the table of the House and offered to take the oath.
This proceeding was objected to, and the majority of the
House (still, as theretofore, composed of members of
different shades of politics) refused to allow you to go
through the form of taking an oath, which, by the hypothesis
on which your original claim to affirm was founded,
as well as by the evidence afforded by a letter of your own,
they held you to be incompetent really to take, and which
they considered it would be a profanation to allow you to
pretend to take.</p>

<p>That was the ground taken by the House on the 23rd
June, 1880, and it is the ground which it has maintained
ever since.</p>

<p>You have, since the adoption of that resolution, made
various attempts to force the House to admit you to a seat,
while still maintaining its objection; and those attempts
have, on more than one occasion, led to scenes of a very
indecent and disorderly character. In its anxiety to prevent
the recurrence of such scenes, the House has felt
itself obliged to adopt measures of rigid exclusion, which
it would gladly have avoided.</p>

<p>I do not think it necessary to enter into the details of
these scenes.</p>

<p>I am, however, obliged to take notice of your allegation
that my action on the 11th February involved a breach of
an arrangement previously made through Mr. Winn.</p>

<p>The arrangement which I authorised Mr. Winn to make
in my name, and which he did make in a letter to Mr.
Labouchere, was as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;If Mr. Bradlaugh will write you a letter to the effect that
he will not go up to the table to take the oath, nor make any
other move with regard to his seat until Monday, February<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_13" id="Page_3_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
11th, and will do so on that day, say immediately after questions,
I am quite sure that Sir Stafford will neither move anything
himself respecting Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s seat, nor employ
anyone else to do so, <i>previous to that day</i>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The meaning of this is perfectly obvious, and it was in
strict conformity with it that I myself abstained, and urged
my friends to abstain, from taking any step whatever in
relation to Mr. Bradlaugh until the day named. When,
upon that day, you came forward in defiance of the
Speaker&#8217;s repeated calls to order, and began to go through
the form of taking the oath, I had no option but to support
the Chair, and to support also the repeatedly pronounced
resolutions of the House in former sessions.</p>

<p>I do not take notice of other passages in your letter
reflecting on the course of the majority, and more particularly
of myself.</p>

<p>But I will add, in conclusion, what your letter does not
show, that your exclusion from the precincts of the House
is terminable at any moment when you may be willing to
undertake not to disturb the proceedings of the House.
The inconveniences of which you complain are inconveniences
which you might, if you chose, put an end to
to-morrow.</p>

<p class="ralign margr5"><i>March 7th, 1884</i>.</p>

<p>To the Right Hon. <span class="smcap">Sir Stafford Northcote</span>, Bart, M.P.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In reply to your favor of the 4th instant, in which
you say that the House held me to be incompetent to take
the oath, will you permit me to answer: 1. That the question
of competence or incompetence to take the oath is one
of law, fit only for the decision of a judicial tribunal, to
which tribunal I have always desired and endeavored to
refer such question. 2. That if the &#8220;principle deliberately
adopted&#8221; by a large majority of the members of the
House of Commons had been that they desired to prevent
&#8220;a profanation of the oath,&#8221; then they ought, during the
sessions of 1882&mdash;1883, to have gladly facilitated the passage
of the Affirmation Bill, which would have prevented
the necessity for the fulfilling by me of that which you
describe as profanation, but which I contend is the duty
imposed on me by law.</p>

<p>In your very temperate historic narrative, you omit the
fact that when the House passed its resolution of the 23rd
June, 1880, it had before it my declaration, made three
weeks earlier, in answer to question 102 of the second
Select Committee:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Any form that I went through, any oath that I took, I
should regard as binding upon my conscience in the fullest degree.
I would go through no form, I would take no oath, unless
I meant it to be so binding.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And as you refer to my letter of the 20th May, printed in
the report of that committee, it is also fair to recall my
answer thereon on the same day to question 197:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_15" id="Page_3_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I ask the Committee in examining it to take it complete,
not to separate one or two words in it and to take those without
the countervailing words, and to remember that in this letter I
declare that the oath, if I take it, would bind me, and I now
repeat that in the most distinct and formal manner; that the
Oath of Allegiance, viz.: &#8216;I do swear that I will be faithful
and bear true allegiance to her Majesty Queen Victoria, her
heirs and successors, according to law,&#8217; will, when I take it, be
most fully, completely, and unreservedly binding upon my
honor and conscience; and I crave leave to refer to the unanimous
judgment of the full Court of the Exchequer Chamber,
in the case of Miller <i>v.</i> Salomons, 17th Jurist, page 463, and
to the case of the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway Company <i>v.</i>
Heaton, 4th Jurist, new series, page 708, for the distinguishment
between the words of asseveration and the essential words
of an oath. But I also desire to add, and I do this most
solemnly and unreservedly, that the taking and subscribing, or
repeating of those words of asseveration, will in no degree
weaken the binding effect of the oath on my conscience.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In your reference to my attempts to take the seat to
which I am by law entitled, you have omitted to state that
on the 27th April, 1881, you personally advised me to wait
for legislation, and that when I did so wait, your friends of
the majority and yourself prevented such legislation.</p>

<p>In recalling the arrangement made by Mr. Winn on
your behalf, you have omitted his most explicit and latest
letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My charge against you is that, despite this agreement,
you had gone down to the House with a resolution prepared
beforehand, and by its wording showing that it
was intended to be moved before I should be able to get
near the table to which you had made me specifically agree
then to come.</p>

<p>You conclude by saying that I can put an end to any
personal inconvenience by undertaking not to disturb the
proceedings of the House. I gave such an undertaking
last year in express words; it is printed in the journals of
the House, and you did not accept it. Immediately before
you moved your resolution of 21st February, you heard
Mr. Speaker read my undertaking to do nothing until a
legal decision was obtained. This you refused, and I have
no reason to suppose that any second offer from me would
be accepted. If what you really desire is that, if the law
decides in my favor, I shall none the less join in your insult
to my constituents by refusing to try to serve in the Parliament
to which they have lawfully returned me, I can
only say that I will never give such an undertaking.</p>

<p>April 2nd.&mdash;After twelve years&#8217; fight and three repulses, Mr.
Charles Bradlaugh is elected member of Parliament for Northampton.
The polling was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Votes cast" style="width:50%;">
<tr>

<p>The <i>Weekly Dispatch</i> said: Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s achievement of the
position he has been aiming at so long and so zealously is a
notable sign of the times. Whatever his critics may think of
him, he will enter Parliament as the representative of a vastly
larger constituency than the whole electorate or the whole population
of Northampton.</p>

<p>The <i>Birmingham Daily Mail</i>: Mr. Bradlaugh holds extreme
views on some subjects, but he will none the less be a useful
man in Parliament, his unflinching courage in the exposure of
abuses being unquestionable.</p>

<p>The <i>Standard</i>: Mr. Bradlaugh, now that he has got to the
House of Commons, is not likely to efface himself in speechless
obscurity.</p>

<p>The <i>Southampton Times</i>: The most signal and portentous
triumph is that which has been achieved by Mr. Bradlaugh. His
election shows what the unity of the Liberal party must have
been.</p>

<p>The <i>Christian World</i>: His contributions to the discussions of
the House may not be without value.</p>

<p>During the election Mr. Samuel Morley telegraphed to Mr.
Labouchere as follows: I strongly urge necessity of united effort
in all sections of Liberal party, and the sinking of minor and
personal questions, with many of which I deeply sympathise, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_4" id="Page_4_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
order to prevent the return, in so pronounced a constituency as
Northampton, of even one Conservative.</p>

<p>April 15th.&mdash;Mr. S. Morley, speaking at Bristol said, respecting
his telegram to Northampton: He made no reference to candidates,
nor did the friend who wrote the telegram go into detail,
but he advised union. Those who had known him all his life
would believe that he viewed with the intensest repugnance
the supposed opinions, both social and religious, of one of the
candidates. Afterwards, writing to the <i>Record</i>, Mr. Morley said
he deeply regretted his telegram.</p>

<p>The <i>Weekly Dispatch</i>, commenting on Mr. Morley&#8217;s conduct,
said: Let the bigots who have taken him to task for his temporary
aberration from the path of pharisaism make what they can of
his pitiful excuse. Other people can only regret that a man so
useful in many ways, both as a politician and a philanthropist,
should show himself so narrow-minded.</p>

<p>The <i>Edinburgh Evening News</i>: In their disappointment, the
defeated party have eagerly caught at the election of Mr. Bradlaugh
as supplying the most pungent taunt that can be thrown
at their victorious opponents.</p>

<p>The <i>Sheffield Telegraph</i>: Bradlaugh is an M.P. ... the
bellowing blasphemer of Northampton.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradlaugh announces that he considers he is legally entitled
to avail himself of the Freethinkers&#8217; affirmation, and that
there is some reason to hope that other members will join him
in that course.</p>

<p>April 17th.&mdash;<i>Sheffield Independent&#8217;s</i> &#8220;London Correspondent&#8221;
says: Tenets which constitute the religious faith of Mr. Bradlaugh
are understood to constitute an insuperable difficulty in
the way of his being sworn a member of &#8220;the faithful Commons.&#8221;</p>

<p>April 29th.&mdash;Parliament opens.</p>

<p>May 3rd.&mdash;At the table of the House Mr. Bradlaugh handed
in a written paper to the Clerk of the House; on this were
written the words: &#8220;To the Right Honorable the Speaker of the
House of Commons. I, the undersigned Charles Bradlaugh, beg
respectfully to claim to be allowed to affirm, as a person for the
time being by law permitted to make a solemn affirmation or declaration,
instead of taking an oath. Charles Bradlaugh.&#8221; Asked if he
desired to state anything to the House, Mr. Bradlaugh said: I
have to submit that the Parliamentary Oaths Act, 1866, gives the
right to affirm to every person for the time being permitted by
law to make affirmation. I am such a person; and under the
Evidence Amendment Act, 1869, and the Evidence Amendment
Act, 1870, I have repeatedly, for nine years past, affirmed in the
highest courts of jurisdiction in this realm. I am ready to make
the declaration or affirmation of allegiance.</p>

<p>At the request of the Speaker Mr. Bradlaugh then withdrew,
in order that the House might consider the claim, and Lord F.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_5" id="Page_4_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Cavendish, urging that it would be manifestly inconvenient that
when any hon. member had applied to take his seat in the House,
any unnecessary delay should intervene, moved the appointment
of a committee of inquiry which should lay before the House the
material on which the House itself should found its decision.
Sir Stafford Northcote seconded. Several other members spoke,
and Mr. Beresford Hope said that the grievance of one man was
very little compared with a great principle; at present the House
of Commons was only a half-hatched chicken. The committee
was then agreed to.</p>

<p>May 11th.&mdash;Appointment of committee carried by 171 votes
against 74, after a two hours&#8217; debate.</p>

<p>May 20th.&mdash;The committee report: &#8220;that in the opinion of the
committee, persons entitled under the provisions of &#8216;the Evidence
Amendment Act, 1869,&#8217; and &#8216;the Evidence Amendment
Act, 1870,&#8217; to make a solemn declaration instead of an oath in
courts of justice, can not be admitted to make an affirmation or
declaration instead of an oath in the House of Commons, in persuance
of the Acts 29 and 30 Vict., c. 19, and 31 and 32 Vict.,
c. 72.&#8221;</p>

<p>The draft report, proposed by the Attorney-General, was to
the effect that &#8220;persons so admitted,&#8221; etc., <i>may be</i> admitted, etc.
This was lost by the casting vote of the chairman (Mr. Walpole),
the other members of the committee voting as follows. Ayes:
Mr. Whitbread, Mr. John Bright, Mr. Massey, Mr. Sergeant
Simon, Sir Henry Jackson, Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Solicitor-General,
Mr. Watkin Williams. Noes: Sir John Holker, Lord
Henry Lennox, Mr. Staveley Hill, Mr. Grantham, Mr. Pemberton,
Mr. Hopwood, Mr. Beresford Hope, Mr. Henry Chaplin.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradlaugh makes a public statement of his position with
regard to the oath. He considered he had a legal right to choose
between the alternatives of making an affirmation or taking the
oath, and he felt it clearly his moral duty, in that case, to make
an affirmation. The oath included words which, to him, were
meaningless, and it would have been an act of hypocrisy to
voluntarily take this form if any other had been open to him.
He should, taking the oath, regard himself as bound not by the
letter of its words, but by the spirit which the affirmation would
have conveyed, had he been allowed to make it, and as soon as
he might be able he should take steps to put an end to the present
doubtful and unfortunate state of the law and practice on
oaths and affirmations.</p>

<p>May 21st.&mdash;Amid a tumult of cries from the Conservative
benches Mr. Bradlaugh goes to the table for the purpose of being
sworn. Sir H. D. Wolff objecting, the Speaker requested Mr.
Bradlaugh to withdraw. He (the Speaker) was bound to say he
knew of no instance in which a member who had offered to take
the oath in the usual form was not allowed by the House to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_6" id="Page_4_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
so. Sir H. D. Wolff then moved that Mr. Bradlaugh should not
be allowed to take the oath, alleging against Mr. Bradlaugh his
repute as an Atheist, and his authorship of &#8220;The Impeachment
of the House of Brunswick.&#8221; Mr. Alderman Fowler seconded
the motion, stating that he held in his hand a petition praying
the House not to alter the law and the custom of the realm for
the purpose of admitting an Atheist to Parliament. Mr. Gladstone,
in the course of replying, said: &#8220;it was not in consequence
of any regulation enforced by the authority of this House&mdash;of a
single branch of the legislature, however complete that authority
may be over the members of this House, that the hon. member
for Northampton presents himself to take the oath at the table.
He presents himself in pursuance of a statutory obligation to
take the oath in order that he may fulfil the duty with which, as
we are given to understand, in a regular and formal manner, his
constituents have entrusted him. That statutory obligation implied
a statutory right.&#8221; He moved that it be referred to a
select committee to consider and report for the information of
the House whether the House has any right to prevent a duly-elected
member, who is willing to take the oath, from doing so.
A long debate ensued, characterised by the fierceness with
which Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s admission to Parliament was opposed.
Mr. John Bright, however, asked if the House were entitled
thus to obstruct what he called the right of a member to take his
seat on account of his religious belief, because it happened that
his belief or no belief had been openly professed, what reason
was there that any member of the House should not be questioned
as to his beliefs, and if the answer were not satisfactory
that the House should not be at liberty to object to his taking his
seat? After two or three adjournments of the debate the Premier&#8217;s
amendment was virtually withdrawn, and a motion by the
Attorney-General was carried to the effect that a committee
should be appointed to report whether it was competent to the
House to prevent Mr. Bradlaugh, by resolution, from taking the
oath.</p>

<p>May 28th.&mdash;Committee nominated&mdash;twenty-three members.</p>

<p>Mr. Labouchere gives notice to ask leave to bring in a Bill to
amend the law of Parliamentary Oaths, to provide that any
member may, if he desire, make a solemn affirmation in lieu of
taking the oath.</p>

<p>June 2nd.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh gives evidence before Select Committee,
in the course of which he said: &#8220;I have never at any
time refused to take the oath of allegiance provided by statute
to be taken by members; all I did was, believing as I then did
that I had the right to affirm, to claim to affirm, and I was then
absolutely silent as to the oath; that I did not refuse to take it,
nor have I then or since expressed any mental reservation, or
stated that the appointed oath of allegiance would not be binding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_7" id="Page_4_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
upon me; that, on the contrary, I say, and have said, that the
essential part of the oath is in the fullest and most complete
degree binding upon my honor and conscience, and that the
repeating of words of asseveration does not in the slightest degree
weaken the binding effect of the oath of allegiance upon me.&#8221;
[It had been persistently represented that Mr. Bradlaugh had
refused to take the oath.] &#8220;Any form that I went through, any
oath that I took, I should regard as binding upon my conscience
in the fullest degree.&#8221;</p>

<p>June 16th.&mdash;The committee report that the compliance by Mr.
Bradlaugh with the form used when an oath is taken would
not be the taking of the oath within the true meaning of the
statutes; that if a member make and subscribe the affirmation
in place of taking the oath it is possible by means of an action
in the High Court of Justice, to test his legal right to do so;
and that the committee recommend that should Mr. Bradlaugh
again seek to make and subscribe the affirmation he be not
prevented from so doing. (Majority in favor of his being
allowed to affirm&mdash;four.)</p>

<p>June 21st.&mdash;Mr. Labouchere moved in the House of Commons
that Mr. Bradlaugh be admitted to make an affirmation instead
of taking the oath, seconded by Mr. M&#8217;Laren. Sir H.
Giffard moved a resolution seeking to debar Mr. Bradlaugh
from both oath and affirmation. Alderman Fowler seconded,
a man who did not believe in a God was not likely to be a man
of high moral character. The majority of the people were
opposed to an Atheist being admitted to Parliament. Many
other members spoke. General Burnaby said the making of
the affirmation by Mr. Bradlaugh would pollute the oath. Mr.
Palmer said Mr. Bradlaugh had a legal right with which the
House had no power to interfere. The Attorney-General said
he had come to the conclusion that Mr. Bradlaugh could not
take the oath, chiefly on the consideration that he was a person
entitled to affirm. Mr. John Bright said it was certainly open
to any member to propose to take either oath or affirmation;
probably if Mr. Bradlaugh had had any suspicion that the
affirmation would have been refused him, he would have taken
the oath as other members take it&mdash;very much, he was afraid,
as a matter of form. Debate adjourned.</p>

<p>June 22nd.&mdash;Mr. Gladstone said that the House, by agreeing
to the amendment, would probably be entering on the commencement
of a long, embarrassing, and a difficult controversy, not
perhaps so much within as beyond the limits of the House,
perhaps with the result of ultimate defeat of the House. The
more he looked at the case the stronger appeared the arguments
which went to prove that in the essence of the law and the
constitution the House had no jurisdiction. In interfering
between a member and what he considered his statutory duty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_8" id="Page_4_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the House might find itself in conflict with either the courts of
law or the constituency of Northampton. No doubt an action
could not be brought against the House, but he was not so
clear that an action could not be brought against the servants
of the House. He was still less willing to face a conflict with
the constituency. The House had commonly been successful
in its controversies with the Crown or House of Lords, but
very different was the issue of its one lamentable conflict with
a constituency.&mdash;Sir Henry Tyler, with execrable taste, dragged
in the name of a lady with whom Mr. Bradlaugh is associated
in business. At last, by a majority of 45&mdash;the numbers voting
being 275 and 230&mdash;another triumph against liberty was scored.</p>

<p>The <i>Christian World</i> regretted that some Nonconformists helped
to swell the Tory majority.</p>

<p>The <i>Jewish World</i> held it as a reproach to Judaism, that members
of their community should have gone over to the party
which once strove to detain them in bondage.</p>

<p>In 1851, Mr. Newdegate protested against the idea &#8220;that they
should have sitting in the House, an individual who regarded
our redeemer as an impostor,&#8221; and yet Baron de Worms voted
with Mr. Newdegate for the exclusion of a man with whose tenets
he disagreed.</p>

<p>The <i>Whitehall Review</i> headed an article &#8220;God <i>v.</i> Bradlaugh,&#8221;
and said the majority had &#8220;protected God from insult.&#8221;</p>

<p>June 23rd.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh again claimed at the table of the
House of Commons to take the oath, and the Speaker having informed
him of the resolution passed the previous evening, requested
his withdrawal. Mr. Bradlaugh thereupon asked to be
heard, and after some debate the demand was complied with.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradlaugh spoke from the bar of the House, asking no
favor, but claiming his right, and warning hon. members against
a conflict with public opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. Labouchere moved, and Mr. Macdonald seconded, the rescindment
of the resolution of the 22nd, which was lost on
division.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradlaugh was then recalled and requested to withdraw
from the House. Standing by the table, he said: &#8220;I respectfully
refuse to obey the order of the House, because the order is
against the law.&#8221; The raging of the bigots and Tories recommenced.
Mr. Gladstone declined to help them out of the pit
into which they had leapt: &#8220;Those who were responsible for the
decision might carry it out as they chose.&#8221; After a sharp discussion
Mr. Bradlaugh was, on the motion of Sir Stafford Northcote,
&#8220;committed to the Clock Tower.&#8221; In the division the numbers
were 274 for and 7 against, the Radicals having left the House.</p>

<p>June 24th.&mdash;On the motion of Sir Stafford Northcote, Mr.
Bradlaugh is released from custody, &#8220;not upon apology, or reparation,
or promise not to repeat his offence, but with the full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_9" id="Page_4_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
knowledge and clear recollection of his announcement that the
offence would be repeated <i>toties quoties</i> till his object was
effected.&#8221;</p>

<p>June 25th.&mdash;Mr. Labouchere gives notice of motion to rescind
the resolution of the 22nd, and Government agreed to give an
early day for the discussion of the same.</p>

<p>June 28th.&mdash;Baron de Ferrieres announced his intention to
move that the seat for Northampton be declared vacant, and that
a Bill be brought in providing for the substitution of an affirmation
for the oath at the option of members. Mr. Wyndham
(Conservative) asked Mr. Gladstone whether the Government
would bring in a Bill to remove all doubts as to the legal right
of members to make a solemn affirmation. Mr. Gladstone said
the Government did not propose to do so, and gave notice for
Thursday (1st July) to move as a standing order that members-elect
be allowed, subject to any liability by statute, to affirm at
their choice. Mr. Labouchere then said he would not proceed
with his motion. On another motion, however, by the same
member, leave was given to bring in a Bill for the amendment
of the Parliamentary Oaths and Affirmations, which was read a
first time.</p>

<p>July 1st.&mdash;After a futile attempt made by Mr. Gorst to show
that Mr. Gladstone&#8217;s resolution was a disorderly one, the Premier,
in moving it said, in the course of an extremely fair speech,
that the allegation of members that Mr. Bradlaugh had thrust
his opinions upon the House was untrue. His (Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s)
reference to the Acts under which he claimed to affirm had only
been named in answer to a question from the clerk of the House.
Sir Erskine May, in his evidence before the recent committee,
stated that Mr. Bradlaugh simply claimed to affirm.</p>

<p>Sir Stafford Northcote admitted that when Mr. Bradlaugh was
called upon to affirm he was not disrespectful, but firm. He
opposed the resolution as humiliating to the House. Several
members protested against any course for facilitating the admission
of Mr. Bradlaugh. General Burnaby stated that in order to
obtain &#8220;authoritative&#8221; opinions on the matter he had obtained
letters or telegrams from the Moravian body, the Bishop of
London, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Ossory, the Bishop
of Ratho, the Archbishop of Dublin, the Bishop of Galway, and
the Bishop of Argyle and the Isles, and the Secretary of the Pope
of Rome, all of whom expressed themselves in the strongest
terms against the admission of an Atheist into Parliament. Mr.
Spurgeon, who was unfortunately from home, had expressed his
opinion strongly adverse to it, and the Chief Rabbi&mdash;(loud
laughter)&mdash;although refusing to interfere with political questions,
felt very deeply on the subject. (Laughter, and cries of &#8220;the
Sultan,&#8221; and &#8220;Shah.&#8221;)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_10" id="Page_4_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>When the House divided the numbers were 303 for, and 249
against.</p>

<p>July 2nd.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh takes the affirmation of allegiance,
and his seat.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>During the struggle several hundreds of indignation meetings
were held in London and the provinces, and petitions, letters,
telegrams, etc., in immense numbers, poured in upon the Government
and the House, in favor of Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s rights.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>July 2nd.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh gives his first vote, and was thereupon
served with a writ to recover against him a penalty of 500
for having voted and sat without having made and subscribed
the oath, the plaintiff being one Henry Lewis Clarke, who, as
subsequently appeared, was merely the tool of the actual common
informer, Charles Newdigate Newdegate, M.P. This writ was
ready so quickly that, if not issued actually before Mr. Bradlaugh
had taken his seat, it must have been prepared beforehand.</p>

<p>July 8th.&mdash;Mr. Norwood asks the first Lord of the Treasury
whether, considering the Government declined to introduce a
bill to amend the Oaths Act, it would instruct the law officers of
the Crown to defend the junior member for Northampton against
the suit of the common informer. Mr. Callan asked whether the
Government would remit the penalty. Mr. Gladstone said no
application had been received for remission of the penalties, and
that his reply to Mr. Norwood must be in the negative.</p>

<p>July 14th.&mdash;Read first time in the House of Commons, a bill
&#8220;to incapacitate from sitting in Parliament any person who has
by deliberate public speaking, or by published writing, systematically
avowed his disbelief in the existence of a supreme being.&#8221;
It was prepared and introduced by Sir Eardley Wilmot, Mr.
Alderman Fowler and Mr. Hicks. Owing to an informality the
Bill could not come on for second reading.</p>

<p>The Rev. Canon Abney, of Derby, speaks of Mr. Bradlaugh as
&#8220;the apostle of filth, impurity, and blasphemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>July 16th.&mdash;Parliament indemnifies Lord Byron against an
action, he having sat and voted without being sworn.</p>

<p>July 20th.&mdash;Sir Eardley Wilmot gives notice of moving that it
is repugnant to the constitution for an Atheist to become a
member of &#8220;this Honorable House.&#8221; He afterwards postponed
his motion.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Dumfries Town Council, a member said:
&#8220;If the law courts should decide that it was legal for an Atheist
to sit in the House of Commons, he should feel it is duty to give
notice of petition to Parliament to have the law altered; he
would not allow Mr. Bradlaugh to go into a hundred acre field
beside cattle, let alone the House of Commons.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rev. Chas. Voysey writes, that he feels disgraced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_11" id="Page_4_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
people of Northampton electing Mr. Bradlaugh, and declares
that &#8220;most of the speeches in the Bradlaugh case in favor of his
exclusion, strike me as singularly good, wholesome and creditable.&#8221;
He repeats the myth of Mr. Bradlaugh forcing his objections
to the oath upon the House.</p>

<p>July 21st.&mdash;Sir John Hay, M.P., speaking about Mr. Bradlaugh
at New Galloway, made a most infamous, cowardly, and uncalled
for attack on Mrs. Besant. The <i>Scotsman</i> refused to print the
remarks, as &#8220;the language was so coarse that it could hardly
have dropped from a Yahoo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aug. 1st.&mdash;The <i>Nineteenth Century</i> prints &#8220;An Englishman&#8217;s
Protest,&#8221; written by Cardinal Manning, personally directed
against Mr. Bradlaugh.</p>

<p>Aug. 24th.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh gives notice that early next session
he will call attention to perpetual pensions.</p>

<p>Sept. 7th.&mdash;Parliament prorogued. Hansard credits Mr. Bradlaugh
with about twenty speeches during the Session. (Mr.
Newdegate told the Licensed Victuallers that Mr. Bradlaugh
&#8220;had made one speech, and proved himself a second or third-rate
speaker.&#8221;)</p>

<p class="center large">1881.</p>

<p>Jan. 6th.&mdash;Parliament reopens. Mr. Bradlaugh renews his
notice as to perpetual pensions. Great interest in the question
throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>Jan. 24th.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh makes a speech in the House of
Commons against Coercion in Ireland.</p>

<p>Jan. 31st.&mdash;Mr. Newdegate, speaking in the House, described
Northampton as an &#8220;oasis in the Midland Counties.&#8221;</p>

<p>Feb. 4th.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh makes a speech against the second
reading of the Coercion Bill, and concluded by moving that it
be read that day six months.</p>

<p>Feb. 15th.&mdash;Date of motion for inquiry into perpetual pensions
fixed for March 15th. (When the day arrived Mr. Bradlaugh,
on an appeal from Mr. Gladstone, allowed the motion to
be postponed, in order to allow supply to be taken. 848 petitions
had been presented to the House, with 251,332 signatures in
favor of the motion.)</p>

<p>Feb. 17th.&mdash;Mr. Dawson, M.P. for Carlow, said that Irish
members were much indebted to Mr. Bradlaugh for what he had
done on the Coercion Bill.</p>

<p>Feb. 25th.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh made final speech against third
reading of the Coercion Bill.</p>

<p>March 7th.&mdash;The case of Clarke <i>v.</i> Bradlaugh heard by Mr.
Justice Mathew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_12" id="Page_4_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>March 10th.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh brought before the House the
case of the imprisoned Maoris.</p>

<p>March 11th.&mdash;Judgment in the case given, which was for the
plaintiff, that he was entitled to recover the penalty, subject to
appeal. Mr. Bradlaugh gave notice of appeal.</p>

<p>Mr. Gorst gave notice to move that Mr. Speaker issue his
warrant for new writ for the borough of Nottingham [!].</p>

<p>March 14th.&mdash;Upon Mr. Bradlaugh rising to present petitions
against perpetual pensions, signed by over 7,000 persons, Mr.
Gorst rose to order, on the ground that the seat for Northampton
was vacant. After discussion the Speaker called upon Mr.
Bradlaugh to proceed with the presentation of his petitions.</p>

<p>March 15th.&mdash;At request of Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Bradlaugh
postponed his motion for enquiry into perpetual pensions.</p>

<p>March 23rd.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh moved the Court of Appeal to
expedite the hearing of his appeal, and also to expedite the trial
of the issues in fact. The Court gave the appeal priority over
other cases.</p>

<p>March 28th.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh made his last speech in the House
against flogging in the Army.</p>

<p>March 30th.&mdash;Appeal heard.</p>

<p>March 31st.&mdash;Judgment given against the defendant. Plaintiff
not yet entitled to execution, but seat vacated, Mr. Bradlaugh
undertaking not to appeal so far as the affirmation was concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradlaugh again seeks the suffrages of the electors of
Northampton.</p>

<p>April 6th.&mdash;The Tories serve notice on the Mayor not to accept
Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s nomination, which the Mayor disregarded. Mr.
Edward Corbett nominated by Tories.</p>

<p>April 9th.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh re-elected by 3,437 votes to Corbett
3,305.</p>

<p>April 26th.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh, accompanied by Mr. Labouchere
and Mr. Burt, came to the table of the House, and, &#8220;the book&#8221;
having been handed to him, was about to take the oath when
Sir Stafford Northcote interposing, he was requested to withdraw,
in order that the House might consider the new conditions
under which the oath was proposed to be taken. Mr. Bradlaugh
withdrew to the bar of the House, and Sir Stafford Northcote
moved that he be not allowed to go through the form of taking
the oath. Mr. Davey moved and Mr. Labouchere seconded an
amendment to the effect that where a person who had been duly
elected presented himself at the table to take the oath he ought
not to be prevented from doing so by anything extraneous to the
transaction. Other members spoke, and Mr. Bright regretted
&#8220;the almost violent temper with which some hon. gentlemen
came to the consideration of the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bradlaugh, speaking at the bar, claimed that his return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_13" id="Page_4_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
was untainted, that it had not been brought about by the Liberal
party, but by the help of the people, by the pence of toilers in
mine and factory. He begged the House not to plunge into a
struggle with him, which he would shun. Strife was easy to
begin, but none knew where it would end. There was no legal
disqualification upon him, and they had no right to impose a
disqualification which was less than legal.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone made a lengthy and fine speech in favor of
Mr. Bradlaugh, the text of which was Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s own
words given above as to imposition of a new disqualification; on
a division, however, the bigots again had it.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradlaugh again stepped to the table, and demanded the
administration of the oath, refusing to obey the Speaker&#8217;s order
to withdraw. Sir Stafford Northcote asked the Prime Minister
whether he proposed to offer the House any counsel. Mr. Gladstone
said he should leave it to the majority to carry out the
effects of their vote. Eventually the Speaker called upon the
Sergeant-at-Arms to remove Mr. Bradlaugh, who during the
debate had been standing at the table. Mr. Bradlaugh withdrawing
with the Sergeant three times to the bar, as often returned
to the table. After further passages at arms between Mr.
Gladstone and Sir Stafford Northcote, the House adjourned.</p>

<p>April 27th.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh again found at the table of the
House claiming to be allowed to take the oath. At the bidding
of the Speaker the Sergeant-at-Arms again caused Mr. Bradlaugh
to withdraw to the bar, where he remained during the discussion
which followed.</p>

<p>Mr. Labouchere asked the Prime Minister whether he would
give him reasonable facilities to introduce his Affirmation Bill, if
so Mr. Bradlaugh would not interfere with the resolution passed
last night.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone said the giving facility for that purpose, meant
the postponement of very serious and very urgent business, and
he had no assurance as to the disposition of the House. He
could not see his way to consent if it was to be an opposed
Bill. After further discussion, however, Mr. Gladstone said it
might be possible to test the feeling of the House by one or more
morning sittings.</p>

<p>April 29th.&mdash;Mr. Gladstone announces the intention of the
Government of bringing in a bill amending the Parliamentary
Oaths Act.</p>

<p>May 2nd.&mdash;The Attorney-General moved that the House resolve
itself into committee with a view of his asking leave to introduce
the Bill. Debate on motion adjourned to the 5th with
the view of fixing the time on the 6th, when the discussion should
be resumed.</p>

<p>Mr. MacIver gave notice to ask the Prime Minister whether he
was prepared to reconsider his decision of last session, and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_14" id="Page_4_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
introduce &#8220;a short measure&#8221; for the partial disfranchisement of
Northampton. (The question was never put.)</p>

<p>May 6th.&mdash;Further obstruction of the Bigots.</p>

<p>May 10th.&mdash;After 1.15 a.m. the Government proposed a morning
sitting for that day (Tuesday), to discuss the introduction of
their Bill. Further obstruction, wrath, and bitterness, and the
Government abandoned the intention to hold a morning sitting.</p>

<p>At the afternoon sitting a resolution was arrived at, which
authorised the Sergeant-at-Arms to prevent Mr. Bradlaugh from
entering the House.</p>

<p>Lord Selborne (Lord Chancellor) in reply to a letter relative
to Mr. Bradlaugh and the oath, says equal justice is due to
Christian and infidel; he saw no possibility of refusing to afford
by legislation to all who scruple to take the oath, the same option
in Parliament as they have in courts of law, to make an affirmation.</p>

<p>May 25th.&mdash;Mr. Newdegate formally blocked the Bill, of which
Mr. Labouchere gave notice, for indemnifying Mr. Bradlaugh
against penalties for having sat and voted on affirmation.</p>

<p>June 19th and 20th.&mdash;The common informer&#8217;s action tried at
<i>Nisi prius</i> before Mr. Justice Grove. Verdict against Mr. Bradlaugh
for penalty and costs.&mdash;<i>Rule nisi</i> for new trial afterwards,
granted by Justices Grove and Lindley; this rule was made
absolute by Justices Denman and Hawkins, but was set aside by
Lords Justices Brett, Cotton and Holker.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Mr. Bradlaugh appeals to the country. The country answers.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Aug. 3rd.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh, acting on his right to enter the
House of Commons, is seized at the door of the House by fourteen
men, police and ushers (Inspector Denning said ten), and
roughly hustled out into Palace Yard, Mr. Bradlaugh protesting
against such treatment as illegal. &#8220;In the passage leading out
to the yard Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s coat was torn down on the right
side; his waistcoat was also pulled open, and otherwise his toilet
was much disarranged. The members flocked down the stairs
on the heels of the struggling party, but no pause was made
until Mr. Bradlaugh was placed outside the precincts and in
Palace Yard.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Times.</i> Alderman Fowler was heard to call,
&#8220;Kick him out.&#8221; This he afterwards denied, but there is evidence
that he did so. (Mr. Bradlaugh suffered the rupture of the
small muscles of both his arms, and erysipelas ensued).</p>

<p>Many thousands of people went up to the House with petitions,
urging the House to do justice to Northampton and Mr. Bradlaugh.</p>

<p>In the House Mr. Labouchere moved a resolution condemning,
as an interference with the privilege of members, the action
of the authorities in expelling Mr. Bradlaugh from the lobby.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_15" id="Page_4_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
This was rejected by 191 votes against 7, and a motion of Sir
Henry Holland, declaring the approval of the House of the
course taken by the Speaker, was agreed to without controversy.</p>

<p>At a crowded meeting at the Hall of Science the same evening
Mr. Bradlaugh stated that he had told Inspector Denning in
Palace Yard that he could come back with force enough to gain
admittance, but that he had no right to risk the lives and liberties
of his supporters.</p>

<p>Aug. 4th.&mdash;The <i>Times</i> declares, in an article favorable on the
whole to Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s claims, that the House of Commons
was yesterday the real sufferer in dignity, authority, and repute.
It says: &#8220;the question contains within itself the baleful germ of
a grave constitutional contest between the House of Commons
and any constituency in the land;&#8221; and &#8220;such a conflict can but
have one conclusion, as all history shows.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Daily News</i>, in a similar article, concludes thus: &#8220;Sooner
or later it will be generally acknowledged that Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s
exclusion was one of the most high-handed acts of which any
legislative body has ever been guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following unique paragraph from <i>The Rock</i> is worth preserving
in its original form: &#8220;The question now is whether the
Christian people of this realm will quietly allow clamorous
groups of infidels, Radicals, and seditionists, by organised
clamor, bluster, and menace, to overawe the legislature, and by
exhibitions of violence&mdash;not at all unlikely, if permitted to
develop into outrage and riot&mdash;to cause an organic and vital
change to be made in our Constitution and laws, in order that
brazen-faced Atheism might display itself within the walls of the
British Parliament.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. E. D. Girdlestone writes: &#8220;If the present Cabinet does
not secure your admission to the House in some way or other, I
can only wish they may soon be turned out of office. I don&#8217;t
know what more I can do than say, &#8216;Go on! and go in!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Aug. 5th.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s application at Westminster Police
Court for summons against Inspector, for having assaulted him
at the House of Commons on the 3rd inst., refused.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradlaugh confined to the House with severe erysipelas in
both arms, resulting from the injuries inflicted. Attended by
Drs. Ramskill and Palfrey. The latter, on August 12th, ordered
his immediate removal from town, to prevent yet more dangerous
complications.</p>

<p>Aug. 13th.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh went to Worthing to recruit his
health. Outside the station there, weary and exhausted, both arms
in a sling, he was rudely stared at by a clergyman, who, having
satisfied himself as to Mr. Bradlaugh&#8217;s identity, walked away
saying loudly: &#8220;There&#8217;s Bradlaugh; I hope they&#8217;ll make it warm
for him yet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_16" id="Page_4_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Northern Star</i> (a Tory paper) suggested that Mr. Bradlaugh
was malingering&mdash;&#8220;simply carrying on the showman
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aug. 24th.&mdash;Sir Henry Tyler, in the House of Commons,
attempts to discredit the South Kensington department for
allowing science and art classes at the Hall of Science. Mr.
Mundella gives those classes great credit.</p>

<p>Aug. 27th.&mdash;Parliament prorogued.</p>

<p>Further appeal to England.</p>

<hr style="width:10%" />

<p class="center large">1882.</p>

<p>Jan. 9th.&mdash;The Earl of Derby, in a speech at the Liverpool
Reform Club, says: &#8220;For my part I utterly disbelieve in the
value of political oaths.... I should hope that if Mr. Bradlaugh
again offers to take the oath, as he did last year, there will
be no further attempt to prevent him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Feb. 7th.&mdash;Reopening of Parliament. Mr. Bradlaugh again
attended at the table to take the oath, and Sir Erskine May, the
clerk of the House, was about to administer the same when Sir
Stafford Northcote, interposing, moved that Mr. Bradlaugh be
not allowed to go through the form. Sir W. Harcourt, in moving
the previous question, said the Government held the view that
the House had no right to interpose between a duly-elected
member and the oath.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradlaugh, addressing the House from the bar for the third
time, begged the House to deal with him with some semblance and
show of legality and fairness. He concluded: &#8220;I want to obey
the law, and I tell you how I might meet the House still further,
if the House will pardon me for seeming to advise it. Hon.
members had said that an Affirmation Bill would be a Bradlaugh
Relief Bill. Bradlaugh is more proud than you are. Let
the Bill pass without applying to elections that have taken place
previously, and I will undertake not to claim my seat, and when
the Bill has passed I will apply for the Chiltern Hundreds. I
have no fear. If I am not fit for my constituents they shall
dismiss me, but you never shall. The grave alone shall make
me yield.&#8221;</p>

<p>When a division was taken there were for the previous question
228, against 286. Mr. Samuel Morley voted with the
majority against the Government. Sir Stafford Northcote&#8217;s
motion was then agreed to without a division.</p>

<p>Feb. 8th.&mdash;Mr. Labouchere, in committee of the whole House,
proposed for leave to bring in a Bill to amend the law of Parliamentary
Oaths and Affirmations. The Bill was afterwards
formally blocked by Mr. Molloy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_17" id="Page_4_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Feb. 17th.&mdash;Mr. Labouchere asked the Attorney-General
whether the resolution of Feb. 7th had not vacated the seat.
Sir Henry James answered that it had not.</p>

<p>Feb. 18th.&mdash;Mr. Gladstone writes Mr. Bradlaugh that the
Government have no measure to propose with respect to his
seat.</p>

<p>Feb. 21st.&mdash;Mr. Bradlaugh of himself takes and subscribes the
oath, and takes his seat.</p>

<p>Feb. 22nd.&mdash;Mr Bradlaugh expelled the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Mar. 2nd&mdash;Re-elected for Northampton. For Bradlaugh,
3,796; for Corbett, 3,688.</p>

<p>Mar. 6th.&mdash;On the motion of Sir Stafford Northcote, the
House reaffirms its motion of the 7th Feb., Mr. Gladstone supporting
an amendment moved by Mr. Marjoribanks, by which the
House would have declared the desirability of legislation, for the
purpose of giving members an option between oath and affirmation.</p>

<p>Mar. 7th.&mdash;Lord Redesdale introduces in the House of Lords
a Bill, requiring every peer and every member of the House of
Commons before taking the oath or making the affirmation, to
declare and affirm his belief in Almighty God. The Bill, introduced
&#8220;from a sense of what was due to Almighty God,&#8221; was
afterwards withdrawn &#8220;in deference to Lord Salisbury.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this date, 317 petitions with 62,168 signatures had been
presented against Mr. Bradlaugh being allowed to take his seat;
while in favor of the same 1,051, with 250,833 signatures, had
been presented.</p>

<p>Mr. Labouchere&#8217;s Affirmation Bill blocked by Earl Percy.</p>

<hr style="width:10%" />

<p class="center large">1883</p>

<p>Jan. 11th.&mdash;Mr. Justice Field gave judgment that the privileges
of the House of Commons prevented Mr. Bradlaugh from
obtaining any redress for the assault upon him on August 3rd,
1881.</p>

<p>Feb. 15th.&mdash;Great demonstration in Trafalgar Square; from
eighty to one hundred thousand people present. (<i>Evening Standard</i>
says 30,000; <i>Daily News</i>, 50,000 an hour before the meeting.)
Mr. Adams, chairman; Rev. W. Sharman, Jos. Arch, and Mr.
Bradlaugh, speakers.</p>

<p>Opening of Parliament. (Mr. Gladstone at Cannes.) Government
give notice for to-morrow for leave to introduce bill to
amend the Oaths Act, 1866. Sir R. Cross gives notice of opposition
on second reading of same. Mr. Bradlaugh consents, with
the approval of his constituents, expressed on the 13th inst., to
await the fate of the measure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_18" id="Page_4_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Feb. 16th.&mdash;Sharp succession of frantic speeches in the House
of Commons by Mr. Newdegate, Alderman Fowler, Mr. Warton,
Mr. Henry Chaplin, Mr. Onslow, Mr. Grantham, Mr. Beresford
Hope, Lord H. Lennox, Lord C. Hamilton, Mr. A. Balfour, Mr.
Ashmead Bartlett, and Mr. A. O&#8217;Connor. Divisions: from two
to three to one for Government. The Marquis of Hartington
consents to adjourn the motion for Bill until Monday at twelve.</p>

<p>Feb. 18th.&mdash;The <i>Observer</i> says that when Conservatives ask
Liberals whether they really mean to alter the law for the purpose
of admitting Mr. Bradlaugh, it is fair for Liberals in turn to ask
Conservatives whether they really mean to maintain an admitted
abuse and injustice for the mere purpose of excluding Mr. Bradlaugh.</p>

<p>Feb. 19th.&mdash;First reading of Bill carried on division by 184
votes to 53; second reading formally fixed for that night week.</p>

<p>Feb. 20th.&mdash;<i>Daily News</i> says Bill will be carried by large
majorities, and will be regarded by the House and the country
as the appropriate settlement of an unfortunate controversy.</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i> says the leaders of the opposition will not
succeed in finally preventing the Bill from becoming law.
Its real concern is that Mr. Bradlaugh has been substantially in
the right; that he has been unjustly excluded from taking the
seat which belongs to him.</p>

<p>The <i>Morning Advertiser</i> thinks the Government may yet find it
difficult to persuade the House to adopt the Bill.</p>

<p>The <i>Morning Post</i> justifies the irregular opposition to the first
reading of the Bill, and thinks notice of the measure should have
been given in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. No measure had created
more excitement or raised more indignation in the country, which
desired to see it rejected by a decisive majority.</p>

<p>March 5th.&mdash;Appeal case Bradlaugh <i>v.</i> Clarke part heard before
the House of Lords.</p>

<p>March 6th.&mdash;Case concluded; judgment deferred.</p>

<p>March 9th.&mdash;Action for maintenance&mdash;Bradlaugh <i>v.</i> Newdegate&mdash;tried
before Lord Coleridge and a special jury. Henry Lewis
Clarke, the common informer, swore that he had not the means
to pay the costs, and would not have brought the action if he
had not been indemnified by Mr. Newdegate. Case adjourned
for argument of legal points.</p>

<p>March 17th.&mdash;Maintenance action argued; four counsel
appearing for Mr. Newdegate. Lord Coleridge reserved judgment.</p>

<p>March 20th.&mdash;The Solicitors to the Treasury compelled Mr.
Bradlaugh to pay the costs of the House of Commons in the
action against the deputy Sergeant-at-Arms.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
